Nervously I stood there under the porch light

As you smiled at me and moved in closer.

You took me in your arms, and my heart began to thud so loudly

I was sure you could hear it but were pretending you didn't.

You moistened your lips, looked deeply into my eyes,

And then gently pressed your lips to mine.

A moment's pause, and you touched my lips with yours again,

A whisper of a kiss that promised more to come.

We kissed again, and during that kiss I felt like I had finally come home.

Looking back, I know I was right as we kiss goodnight and I turn out the light.
