Learning from a Pandemic. The Impact
of COVID-19 on Education Around
the World
Fernando M. Reimers

Abstract This introductory chapter sets the stage for the book, explaining the goals,
methods, and significance of the comparative study. The chapter situates the theoretical significance of the study with respect to research on education and inequality, and
argues that the rare, rapid, and massive change in the social context of schools caused
by the pandemic provides a singular opportunity to study the relative autonomy of
educational institutions from larger social structures implicated in the reproduction
of inequality. The chapter provides a conceptual educational model to examine the
impact of COVID-19 on educational opportunity. The chapter describes the evolution
of the COVID-19 pandemic and how it resulted into school closures and in the rapid
deployment of strategies of remote education. It examines available evidence on the
duration of school closures, the implementation of remote education strategies, and
known results in student access, engagement, learning, and well-being.

1.1 Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic shocked education systems in most countries around the
world, constraining educational opportunities for many students at all levels and
in most countries, especially for poor students, those otherwise marginalized, and
for students with disabilities. This impact resulted from the direct health toll of the
pandemic and from indirect ripple effects such as diminished family income, food
insecurity, increased domestic violence, and other community and societal effects.
The disruptions caused by the pandemic affected more than 1.7 billion learners,
including 99% of students in low and lower-middle income countries (OECD, 2020c;
United Nations, 2020, p. 2).
While just around 2% of the world population (168 million people as of May 27,
2021) had been infected a year after the coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan,
China, and only 2% of those infected (3.5 million) had lost their lives to the virus
(World Health Organization, 2021a), considerably more people were impacted by

the policy responses put in place to contain the spread of the virus. Beyond the
infections and fatalities reported as directly caused by COVID-19, analysis of the
excess mortality since the pandemic outbreak, suggests that an additional 3 million
people may have lost their lives to date because of the virus (WHO, 2021b).
As the General Director of the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of
COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January
30, 2020 (WHO, 2020a), countries began to adopt a range of policy responses to
contain the spread of the virus. The adoption of containment practices accelerated as
the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 (WHO,
2020b).
Chief among those policy responses were the social distancing measures which
reduced the ability of many people to work, closed businesses, and reduced the ability
to congregate and meet for a variety of purposes, including teaching and learning. The
interruption of in-person instruction in schools and universities limited opportunities
for students to learn, causing disengagement from schools and, in some cases, school
dropouts. While most schools put in place alternative ways to continue schooling
during the period when in-person instruction was not feasible, those arrangements
varied in their effectiveness, and reached students in different social circumstances
with varied degrees of success.
In addition to the learning loss and disengagement with learning caused by the
interruption of in-person instruction and by the variable efficacy of alternative forms
of education, other direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic diminished the ability
of families to support children and youth in their education. For students, as well
as for teachers and school staff, these included the economic shocks experienced by
families, in some cases leading to food insecurity, and in many more causing stress
and anxiety and impacting mental health. Opportunity to learn was also diminished by
the shocks and trauma experienced by those with a close relative infected by the virus,
and by the constraints on learning resulting from students having to learn at home,
and from teachers having to teach from home, where the demands of schoolwork had
to be negotiated with other family necessities, often sharing limited space and, for
those fortunate to have it, access to connectivity and digital devices. Furthermore,
the prolonged stress caused by the uncertainty over the evolution and conclusion of
the pandemic and resulting from the knowledge that anyone could be infected and
potentially lose their lives, created a traumatic context for many that undermined
the necessary focus and dedication to schoolwork. These individual effects were
reinforced by community effects, particularly for students and teachers living in
communities where the multifaceted negative impacts resulting from the pandemic
were pervasive.
Beyond these individual and community effects of the pandemic on students,
and on teachers and school staff, the pandemic also impacted education systems
and schools. Burdened with multiple new demands for which they were unprepared,
and in many cases inadequately resourced, the capacity of education leaders and
administrators, who were also experiencing the previously described stressors faced
by students and teachers, was stretched considerably. Inevitably, the institutional
bandwidth to attend to the routine operations and support of schools was diminished

1 Learning from a Pandemic. The Impact of COVID-19 …

3

and, as a result, the ability to manage and sustain education programs was hampered.
Routine administrative efforts to support school operations as well as initiatives to
improve them were affected, often setting these efforts back.
Published efforts to take stock of the educational impact of the pandemic to date,
as it continues to unfold, have largely consisted of collecting and analyzing a limited
number of indicators such as enrollment, school closures, or reports from various
groups about the alternative arrangements put in place to sustain educational opportunity, including whether, when, and how schools were open for in-person instruction and what alternative arrangements were made to sustain education remotely.
Often these data have been collected in samples of convenience, non-representative,
further limiting the ability to obtain true estimates of the education impact of the
pandemic on the student population. A recent review of research on learning loss
during the pandemic identified only eight studies, all focusing on OECD countries
which experienced relatively short periods of school closures (Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Spain, the United States, Australia, and Germany). These studies
confirm learning loss in most cases and, in some, increases in educational inequality,
but they also document heterogeneous effects of closures on learning for various
school subjects and education levels (Donelly & Patrinos, 2021).
There have also been predictions of the likely impact of the pandemic, consisting
mostly of forecasts and simulations based on extrapolations of what is known about
the interruption of instruction in other contexts and periods. For example, based on an
analysis of the educational impact of the Ebola outbreaks, Hallgarten identified the
following likely drivers of school dropouts during COVID-19: (1) the reduction in the
availability of education services, (2) the reduction in access to education services,
(3) the reduction in the utilization of schools, and (4) lack of quality education.
Undergirding these drivers of dropout are these factors: (a) school closures, (b) lack
of at-home educational materials, (c) fear of school return and emotional stress caused
by the pandemic, (d) new financial hardships leading to difficulties paying fees, or
to children taking up employment, (e) lack of reliable information on the evolution
of the pandemic and on school reopenings, and (f) lack of teacher training during
crisis. (Hallgarten, 2020, p. 3).
Another type of estimate of the likely educational cost of the pandemic includes
forecasts of the future economic costs for individuals and for society. A simulation of
the impact of a full year of learning loss estimated it as a 7.7% decline in discounted
GDP (Hanushek & Woessman, 2020). The World Bank estimated the cost of the
education disruption as a $10 trillion dollars in lost earnings over time for the current
generation of students (World Bank, 2020).
Many of the reports to date of the educational responses to the pandemic and their
results are in fact reports of intended policy responses, often reflecting the views
of the highest education authorities in a country, a view somewhat removed from
the day-to-day realities of teachers and students and that provides information about
policy intent rather than on the implementation and actual effect of those policies. For
instance, the Inter-American Development Bank conducted a survey of the strategies
for education continuity adopted by 25 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean
during the first phase of the crisis, concluding that most had relied on the provision

4

F. M. Reimers

of digital content on web-based portals, along with the use of TV, radio, and printed
materials, and that very few had integrated learning management systems, and only
one country had kept schools open (Alvarez et al., 2020).
These reports, valuable as they are, are limited in what they contribute to understanding the ways in which education systems, teachers, and students were impacted
by the pandemic and about how they responded, chiefly because it is challenging
to document the impact of an unexpected education emergency in real time, and
because it will take time to be able to ascertain the full short- and medium-term
impact of this global education shock.

1.2 Goals and Significance of this Study
This book is a comparative effort to discern the short-term educational impact of the
pandemic in a selected number of countries, reflecting varied levels of financial and
institutional education resources, a variety of governance structures, varied levels of
education performance, varied regions of the world, and countries of diverse levels
of economic development, income per capita, and social and economic inequality.
Our goal is to contribute an evidence-based understanding of the short-term educational impact of the pandemic on students, teachers, and systems in those countries,
and to discuss the likely immediate effects of such an impact. Drawing on thirteen
national case studies, a chapter presenting a comparative perspective in five OECD
countries and another offering a global comparative perspective, we examine how
the pandemic impacted education systems and educational opportunity for students.
Such systematic stock-taking of how the pandemic impacted education is important
for several reasons. The first is that an understanding of the full global educational
impact of the pandemic necessitates an understanding of the ways in which varied
education systems responded (such as the nature and duration of school closures,
alternative means of education delivery deployed, and the goals of those strategies
of education continuity during the pandemic) and of the short-term results of those
responses (in terms of school attendance, engagement, learning and well-being for
different groups of students). In order to understand the possible student losses in
knowledge and skills, or in educational attainment that the current cohort of students
will experience relative to previous or future cohorts, and to understand the consequences of such losses, we must first understand the processes through which the
pandemic influenced their opportunities to learn. Such systematization and stocktaking are also essential to plan for remediation and recovery, in the immediate
aftermath of the pandemic and beyond. While the selection of countries was not
intended to represent the entire world, the knowledge gained from the analysis of
the educational impact of the pandemic on these diverse cases, as well as making
visible what is not yet known, will likely have heuristic value to educators designing
mitigation and remediation strategies in a wide variety of settings and may provide
a useful framework to design further research on this topic.

In addition, the pandemic is likely to exacerbate preexisting challenges and to
create new ones, increasing unemployment for instance or contributing to social fragmentation, which require education responses. Furthermore, there were numerous
education challenges predating the pandemic that need attention. Addressing these
new education imperatives, as well as tackling preexisting ones, requires ‘building
back better’; not just restoring education systems to their pre-pandemic levels of functioning, but rather realigning them to these new challenges. Examining the short-term
education response to the pandemic provides insight into whether the directionality
of such change is aligned to ‘building back better’ and with the kind of priorities that
should guide those efforts during the remainder of the pandemic and in the pandemic
aftermath.
Lastly, the pandemic provides a rare opportunity to help us understand how education institutions relate to other institutions and to their external environment under
conditions of rapid change. Much of what we know about the relationship of schools
to their external environment is based on research carried out in much more stable
contexts, where it is difficult to discern what is a cause and what is an effect. For
instance, there is robust evidence that schools often reflect and contribute to reproducing social stratification, providing children from different social origins differential opportunities to learn, and resulting in children of poor parents receiving less
and lower quality schooling than children of more affluent parents. It is also the
case that educational attainment is a robust predictor of income. Increases in income
inequality correlate with increases in education inequality, although government
education policies have been shown to mitigate such a relationship (Mayer, 2010).
The idea that education policy can mitigate the structural relationship between
education and income inequality suggests that the education system has certain
autonomy from the larger social structure. But disentangling to what extent school
policy and schools can just reproduce social structures or whether they can transform social relations is difficult because changes in education inequality and social
inequality happen concurrently and slowly, which makes it difficult to establish
what is cause and what is effect. However, a pandemic is a rare rapid shock to that
external environment, the equivalent of a solar eclipse, and thus a singular opportunity to observe how schools and education systems respond when their external
environment changes, quite literally, overnight. Such a shock will predictably have
disproportionate impacts on the poor, via income and health effects, presenting a
unique opportunity to examine whether education policies are enacted to mitigate
the resulting disproportionate losses on educational opportunity from such income
and health shocks for the poor and to what extent they are effective.

1.3 A Stylized Global Summary of the Facts
A full understanding of the educational impact of the pandemic on systems, educators, and students will require an analysis of such impact in three time frames:
the immediate impact, taking place while the pandemic is ongoing; the immediate

6

aftermath, as the epidemic comes under control, largely as a result of the population having achieved herd immunity after the majority has been inoculated; and the
medium term aftermath, once education systems, societies, and economies return to
some stability. Countries will differ in the timeline at which they transition through
these three stages, as a function of the progression of the pandemic and success
controlling it, as a result of public health measures and availability, distribution, and
uptake of vaccines, and as a result of the possible emergence of new more virulent
strands of the virus which could slow down the efforts to contain the spread. There are
challenges involved in scaling up the production and distribution of vaccines, which
result in considerable inequalities in vaccination rates among countries of different
income levels. It is estimated that 11 billion doses of vaccines are required to achieve
global herd immunity (over 70% of the population vaccinated). By May 24, 2021,
a total of 1,545,967,545 vaccine doses had been administered (WHO, 2021a), but
75% of those vaccines have been distributed in only 10 high income countries (WHO,
2021c).
Of the 9.5 billion doses expected to be available by the end of 2021, 6 billion doses
have already been purchased by high and upper middle-income countries, whereas
low- and lower-income countries—where 80% of the world population lives—have
only secured 2.6 billion, including the pledges to COVAX, an international development initiative to vaccinate 20% of the world population (Irwin, 2021). At this rate,
it is estimated that it will take at least until the end of 2022 to vaccinate the lowest
income population in the world (Irwin, 2021).
The educational impact of the pandemic in each of these timeframes will likely
differ, as will the challenges that educators and administrators face in each case,
with the result that the necessary policy responses will be different in each case. The
immediate horizon—what could be described as the period of emergency—can in
turn be further analyzed in various stages since, given the relatively long duration of
the pandemic, spanning over a year, schools and systems were able to evolve their
responses in tandem with the evolution of the epidemic and continued to educate to
varying degrees as a result of various educational strategies of education continuity
adopted during the pandemic. During the initial phase of this immediate impact, the
responses were reactive, with very limited information on their success, and with
considerable constraints in resources available to respond effectively. This initial
phase of the emergency was then followed by more deliberate efforts to continue
to educate, in some cases reopening schools—completely or in part—and by more
coordinated and comprehensive actions to provide learning opportunities remotely.
The majority of the analysis presented in this book focuses on this immediate horizon,
spanning the twelve months between January of 2020, when the pandemic was
beginning to extend beyond China, as the global outbreak was recognized on March
11, through December of 2020.
The pandemic’s impact in the immediate aftermath and beyond will not be a focus
of this book, largely because most countries in the world have not yet reached a postpandemic stage, although the concluding chapter draws out implications from the
short-term impact and responses for that aftermath.

Education policy responses need to differentially address each of these three
timeframes: short-term mitigation of the impact during the emergency; immediate
remediation and recovery in the immediate aftermath; and medium-term recovery
and improvement after the initial aftermath of the pandemic.
As the epidemic spread from Wuhan, China—where it first broke out in December
of 2019—throughout the world, local and national governments suspended the operation of schools as a way to contain the rapid spread of the virus. Limiting gatherings
in schools, where close proximity would rapidly spread respiratory infections, had
been done in previous pandemics as a way to prevent excess demand for critical
emergency services in hospitals. Some evidence studying past epidemics suggested
in fact that closing schools contributed to slow down the spread of infections. A
study of non-pharmaceutical interventions adopted during the 1918–19 pandemic in
the United States shows that mortality was lower in cities that closed down schools
and banned public gatherings (Markel et al., 2007). A review of 79 epidemiological studies, examining the effect of school closures on the spread of influenza and
pandemics, found that school closures contributed to contain the spread (Jackson
et al., 2013).
In January 26, China was the first country to implement a national lockdown of
schools and universities, extending the Spring Festival. As UNESCO released the first
global report on the educational impact of the pandemic on March 3, 2020, twentytwo countries had closed schools and universities as part of the measures to contain
the spread of the virus, impacting 290 million students (UNESCO, 2020). Following
the World Health Organization announcement, on March 11, 2020, that COVID-19
was a global pandemic, the number of countries closing schools increased rapidly.
In the following days 79 countries had closed down schools (UNESCO, 2020).
Following the initial complete closure of schools in most countries around the
world there was a partial reopening of schools, in some cases combined with localized
closings. By the end of January 2021, UNESCO estimated that globally, schools had
completely closed an average of 14 weeks, with the duration of school closures
extending to 22 weeks if localized closings were included (UNESCO, 2021). There
is great variation across regions in the duration of school closures, ranging from
20 weeks of complete national closings in Latin America and the Caribbean to just
one month in Oceania, and 10 weeks in Europe. There is similar variation with respect
to localized closures, from 29 weeks in Latin America and the Caribbean to 7 weeks
in Oceania, as seen in Fig. 1.1. By January 2021, schools were fully open in 101
countries.
As it became clear that it would take considerable time until a vaccine to
prevent infections would become available, governments began to consider options
to continue to educate in the interim. These options ranged from total or partial
reopening of schools to creating alternative means of delivery, via online instruction,
distributing learning packages, deploying radio and television, and using mobile
phones for one- or two-way communication with students. In most cases, deploying
these alternative means of education was a process of learning by doing, sometimes improvisation, with a rapid exchange of ideas across contexts about what
was working well and about much that was not working as intended. As previous

8

experience implementing these measures in a similar context of school lockdown
was limited, there was not much systematized knowledge about what ‘worked’ to
transfer any approach with some confidence of what results it would produce in the
context created by the pandemic. As these alternatives were put in place, educators
and governments learned more about what needs they addressed, and about which
ones they did not.
For instance, it soon became apparent that the creation of alternative ways to
deliver instruction was only a part of the challenge. Since in many jurisdictions
schools deliver a range of services—from food to counseling services—in addition
to instruction, it became necessary to find alternative ways to deliver those services
as well, not just to meet recognized needs prior to the pandemic but because the
emergency was increasing poverty, food insecurity, and mental health challenges,
making such support services even more essential.
As governments realized that the alternative arrangements to deliver education
had diminished the capacity to achieve the instructional goals of a regular academic
year, it became necessary to reprioritize the focus of instruction.
In a study conducted at the end of April and beginning of May 2020, based on a
survey administered to a haphazard sample of teachers and education administrators
in 59 countries, we found that while schools had been closed in all cases, plans
for education continuity had been implemented in all countries we had surveyed.
Those plans involved using existing online resources, online instruction delivered
by students’ regular teachers, instructional packages with printed resources, and

1 Learning from a Pandemic. The Impact of COVID-19 …

9

educational television programmes. The survey revealed severe disparities in access
to connectivity, devices, and the skills to use them among children from different
socio-economic backgrounds. On balance, however, the strategies for educational
continuity were rated favourably by teachers and administrators, who believed they
had provided effective opportunities for student learning. These strategies prioritized
academic learning and provided support for teachers, whereas they gave less priority
to the emotional and social development of students.
These strategies deployed varied mechanisms to support teachers, primarily by
providing them access to resources, peer networks within the school and across
schools, and timely guidance from leadership. A variety of resources were used to
support teacher professional development, mostly relying on online learning platforms, tools that enabled teachers to communicate with other teachers, and virtual
classrooms (Reimers & Schleicher, 2020).
Some countries relied more heavily on some of these approaches, while others
used a combination, as reported by UNESCO and seen in Fig. 1.2.
A significant number of children did not have access to the online solutions
provided because of lack of connectivity, as shown in a May 2020 report by UNESCO.
In Sub-Saharan Africa, a full 80% of children lacked internet at home; this figure
was 49% in Asia Pacific; 34% in the Arab States and 39% in Latin America, but it
was only 20% in Eastern Europe and Central Asia and 14% in Western Europe and
North America (Giannini, 2020).
Similar results were obtained by a subsequent cross-national study administered to senior education planning officials in ministries of education, conducted
by UNESCO, UNICEF, and the World Bank. These organizations administered
two surveys between May and June 2020, and between July and October 2020,
to government officials in 118 and 149 countries, respectively. The study documented extended periods of school closures. The study further documented differences among countries in whether student learning was monitored, with much greater
levels of monitoring in high income countries than in lower income countries.

platforms. Source Giannini (2020)

The study also confirmed that most governments created alternative education
delivery systems during the period when schools were closed, through a variety of
modalities including online platforms, television, radio, and paper-based instructional packages. Governments also adopted targeted measures to support access to
these platforms for disadvantaged students, provided devices or subsidized connectivity, and supported teachers and caregivers. The report shows disparities between
countries at different income levels, with most high-income countries providing such
support and a third of lower income countries not providing any specific support for
connectivity to low-income families (UNESCO-UNICEF-the World Bank, 2020).
The UNESCO-UNICEF-World Bank surveys reveal considerable differences in
the education responses by level of income of the country. For instance, whereas
by the end of September of 2020 schools in high-income countries had been closed
27 days, on average, that figure increased to 40 days in middle-income countries, to
68 days in lower middle-income countries, and to 60 days in low-income countries
(Ibid, 15).
For most countries there were no plans to systematically assess levels of students’
knowledge and skills as schools reopened, and national systematic assessments were
suspended in most countries. There was considerable variation across countries,
and within countries, in terms of when schools reopened and how they did so.
Whereas some countries offered both in-person and remote learning options—and
gave students a choice of which approach to use—others did not offer choices. There
were also variations in the amount of in-person instruction students had access to once
schools reopened. Some schools and countries introduced measures to remediate
learning loss as schools reopened, but not all did.

1.4 The Backdrop to the Pandemic: Enormous
and Growing Inequality and Social Exclusion
The pandemic impacted education systems as they faced two serious interrelated
preexisting challenges: educational inequality and insufficient relevance. A considerable growth in economic inequality, especially among individuals within the same
nations, has resulted in challenges of social inclusion and legitimacy of the social
contract, particularly in democratic societies. Over the last thirty years, income
inequality has increased in countries such as China, India, and most developed countries. Over the last 25 years there are also considerable inequalities between nations,
even though those have diminished over the last 25 years. The average income of a
person in North America is 16 times greater than the income of the average person in
Sub-Saharan Africa. 71% of the world’s population live in countries where inequality
has grown (UN, 2021). The Great Recession of 2008–2009 worsened this inequality
(Smeedling, 2012).
One of the correlates of income inequality is educational inequality. Studies show
that educational expansion (increasing average years of schooling attainment and
reducing inequality of schooling) relates to a reduction in income inequality (Coadi &
Dizioly, 2017). But education systems, more often than not, reflect social inequalities,
as they offer the children of the poor, often segregated in schools of low quality,
deficient opportunities to learn skills that help them improve their circumstances,
whereas they provide children from more affluent circumstances opportunities to gain
knowledge and skills that give them access to participate economically and civically.
In doing so, schools serve as a structural mechanism that reproduces inequality, and
indeed legitimize it as they obscure the structural forces that sort individuals into
lives of vastly different well-being with an ideology of meritocracy that in effect
blames the poor for the circumstances that their lack of skills lead to, when they have
not been given effective opportunities to develop such skills.
There is abundant evidence of the vastly different learning outcomes achieved by
students from different social origins, and of the differences in the educational environments they have access to. In the most recent assessment of student knowledge
and skills conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the socioeconomic status of students is significantly correlated to
student achievement in literacy, math, and science in all 76 countries participating
in the study (OECD, 2019). On average, among OECD countries, 12% of the variance in reading performance is explained by the socioeconomic background of the
student. The strength of this relationship varies across countries, in some of them
it is lower than the average as is the case in Macao (1.7%), Azerbaijan (4.3%),
Kazakhstan (4.3%), Kosovo (4.9%), Hong Kong (5.1%), or Montenegro (5.8%).
In other countries, the strength of the relationship between socioeconomic background and reading performance is much greater than the average such as in Belarus
(19.8%), Romania (18.1%), Philippines (18%), or Luxembourg (17.8%). A significant reading gap exists between the students in the bottom 25% and those in the
top 25% of the socioeconomic distribution, averaging 89 points, which is a fifth of

12

F. M. Reimers

the average reading score of 487, and almost a full standard deviation of the global
distribution of reading scores in PISA. In spite of these strong associations between
social background and reading achievement, there are students who defy the odds; the
percentage of students whose social background is at the bottom 25%—the poorest
students—whose reading performance is in the top 25%—academically resilient
students—averages 11% across all OECD countries. This percentage is much greater
in the countries where the relationship between social background and achievement is
lower. In Macao, for instance, 20% of the students in the top 25% of achievement are
among the poorest 25%. In contrast, in countries with a strong relationship between
socioeconomic background and reading achievement, the percentage of academically resilient students among the poor is much lower, in Belarus and Romania it is
9%. These differences in reading skills by socioeconomic background are even more
pronounced when looking at the highest levels of reading proficiency, those at which
students can understand long texts that involve abstract and counterintuitive concepts
as well as distinguish between facts and opinions based on implicit clues about the
source of the information. Only 2.9% of the poorest students, compared with 17.4%
among the wealthier quarter, can read at those levels of proficiency on average for
the OECD (OECD, 2019b, p. 58). Table 1.1 summarizes socioeconomic disparities
in reading achievement. The relationship of socioeconomic background to students’
knowledge and skills is stronger for math and science. On average, across the OECD,
13.8% of math skills and 12.8% of science skills are predicted by socioeconomic
background.
The large number of children who fail to gain knowledge and skills in schools has
been characterized, by World Bank staff and others, as ‘a global learning crisis’ or
‘learning poverty’, though the evidence on the strong correlation of learning poverty
to family poverty suggests that this should more aptly be characterized as ‘the learning
crisis for the children of the poor’ (World Bank, 2018). These low levels of learning
have direct implications for the ability of students to navigate the alternative education
arrangements put in place to educate during the pandemic; clearly students who can
read at high levels are more able to study independently through texts and other
resources than struggling readers.
The second interrelated challenge is that of ensuring that what ALL children learn
in school is relevant to the challenges of the present and, most importantly, of the
future. While the challenge of the relevance of learning is not new in education, the
rapid developments in societies, resulting from technologies and politics, create a new
urgency to address it. For students with the capacity to set personal learning goals, or
with more self-management skills, or with greater skills in the use of technology, or
with greater flexibility and resiliency, or with prior experience with distance learning,
it was easier to continue to learn through the remote arrangements established to
educate during the pandemic than it was for students with less developed skills in
those domains. While the emphasis on the development of such breadth of skills, also
called twenty-first century skills, has been growing around the world, as reflected in
a number of recent curriculum reforms, there are large gaps between the ambitious
aspirations reflected in modern curricula and standards, and the implementation of
those reforms and instructional practice (Reimers, 2020b; Reimers, 2021).

The challenges of low efficacy and relevance have received attention from governments and from international development agencies, including the United Nations
and the OECD. The UN Sustainable Development Goals, for instance, propose a
vision for education that aligns with achieving an inclusive and sustainable vision
for the planet, even though, by most accounts, the resources deployed to finance the
achievement of the education goal fall short with respect to those ambitions. In 2019
UNESCO’s director general tasked an international commission with the preparation
of a report on the Futures of Education, focusing in particular on the question of how
to align education institutions with the challenges facing humanity and the planet.

1.5 The Pandemic and Health
The main direct effect of the Coronavirus disease is in infecting people, compromising their health and in some cases causing their death. By May 27 of 2021,
168,040,871 people worldwide had become infected, of whom 3,494,758 had died
reportedly from COVID-19 (World Health Organization, 2021a) and an additional
3 million had likely died from COVID-19 as they were excess deaths relative to the
total number of deaths the previous year (World Health Organization, 2021b). As
expected, more people are infected in countries with larger populations, but the rate
of infection by total population and the rate of deaths by total population suggest
variations in the efficacy of health policies used to contain the spread as shown in
Fig. 1.4, which includes the top 20 countries with the highest relative number of
COVID-19 fatalities. These differences reflect differences in the efficacy of health
policies to contain the pandemic, as well as differences in the response of the population to guidance from public health authorities. Countries in which political leaders
did not follow science-based advice to contain the spread, and in which a considerable share of the population did not behave in ways that contributed to mitigate the
spread of the virus, not wearing face masks or socially distancing for instance, such
as in Brazil and the United States, fared much poorer than those who did implement
effective public health containment measures such as China, South Korea, or Singapore, with such low numbers of deaths per 100,000 people that they are not even on
this chart of the top 20.

1.6 The Pandemic, Poverty, and Inequality
The social distancing measures limited the ability of business to operate, reducing
household income and demand. This produced an economic recession in many countries. For example, in the United States, 43% of small businesses closed temporarily
(Bartik et al., 2020).
A household survey in seventeen countries in Latin America and the Caribbean
demonstrates that the COVID-19 pandemic differentially impacted households at

1 Learning from a Pandemic. The Impact of COVID-19 …

different income levels. The study shows significant and unequal job losses with
stronger effects among the lowest income households. The study revealed that 45%
of respondents reported that a member of their household had lost a job and that,
for those owning a small family business, 58% had a household member who had
closed their business. These effects are considerably more pronounced among the
households with lower incomes, with nearly 71 percent reporting that a household
member lost their job and 61 percent reporting that a household member closed their
business compared to only 14 percent who report that a household member lost their
job and 54 percent reporting that a household member closed their business among
those households with higher incomes (Bottan et al., 2020).
It is estimated that the global recession augmented global extreme poverty by 88
million people in 2020, and an additional 35 million in 2021 (World Bank, 2020). A
survey conducted by UNICEF in Mexico documented a 6.7% increase in hunger and
a 30% loss in household income between May and July of 2020 (UNICEF México,
2020).
Because schools in some countries offer a delivery channel for meals as part of
poverty reduction programming, several countries created alternative arrangements
during the pandemic to deliver those or replaced them with cash transfer programs.

24

F. M. Reimers

Sao Paulo, Brazil, for instance, created a cash transfer program “Merenda en Casa”
to replace the daily meal school programs (Dellagnelo & Reimers, 2020; Sao Paulo
Government, 2020).
In the summer of 2020, Save the Children conducted a survey of children and
families in 46 countries to examine the impact of the crisis, focusing on participants in
their programs, other populations of interest, and the general public. The report of the
findings for program participants—which include predominantly vulnerable children
and families—documents violence at home, reported in one third of the households.
Most children (83%) and parents (89%) reported an increase in negative feelings
due to the pandemic and 46% of the parents reported psychological distress in their
children. For children who were not in touch with their friends, 57% were less happy,
54% were more worried, and 58% felt less safe. For children who could interact with
their friends less than 5% reported similar feelings. Children with disabilities showed
an increase in bed-wetting (7%) and unusual crying and screaming (17%) since the
outbreak of the pandemic, an increase three times greater than for children without
disabilities. Children also reported an increase in household chores assigned to them,
63% for girls and 43% for boys, and 20% of the girls said their chores were too many
to be able to devote time to their studies, compared to 10% of boys (Ritz et al., 2020).

1.7 Readiness for Remote Teaching During a Pandemic
Countries varied in the extent to which they had, prior to the pandemic, supported
teachers and students in developing the capacities to teach and to learn online, and
they varied also in the availability of resources which could be rapidly deployed as
part of the remote strategy of educational continuity. Table 1.2 shows the extent to
which teachers were prepared to use Information and Communication Technologies
(ICT) in their teaching based on a survey administered by the OECD in 2018. The
percentage of teachers who report that the use of ICT was part of their teacher preparation ranges from 37 to 97%. There is similar variation in the percentage of teachers
who feel adequately prepared to use ICT, or who have received recent professional
development in ICT, or who feel a high need for professional development in ICT.
There is also quite a range in the percentage of teachers who regularly allow students
to use ICT as part of their schoolwork.
This variation, along with variation in availability of technology and connectivity
among students, creates very different levels of readiness to teach remotely online
as part of the strategy of educational continuity during the interruption of in-person
instruction.

1.8 What are the Short-term Educational Impacts
of the Pandemic?
The study of the ways in which the pandemic can be expected to influence the
opportunity to learn can be based on what is known about the determinants of access
to school and learning, drawing on research predating the pandemic.
Opportunity to learn can be usefully disaggregated into opportunity to access and
regularly attend school, and opportunity to learn while attending and engaging in
school. John Carroll proposed a model for school learning which underscored the
primacy of learning time. In his model, learning is a function of time spent learning
relative to time needed to learn. This relationship between aptitude (time needed to
learn) and learning is mediated by opportunity to learn (amount of time available for
learning), ability to understand instruction, quality of instruction, and perseverance
(Carroll, 1963).
In a nutshell, the pandemic limited student opportunity for interactions with
peers and teachers and for individualized attention—decreasing student engagement,
participation, and learning—while augmenting the amount of at-home work which,
combined with greater responsibilities and disruptions, diminished learning time
while increasing stress and anxiety, and for some students, aggravated mental health
challenges. The pandemic also increased teacher workload and stress while creating
communication and organizational challenges among school staff and between them
and parents.
Clearly the pandemic constrained both the home conditions and the school conditions that support access to school, regular attendance, and time spent learning. The
alternative strategies deployed to sustain the continuity of schooling in all likelihood only partially restored opportunity to learn and quality of instruction. Given
the lower access that disadvantaged students had to technology and connectivity,
and the greater likelihood that their families were economically impacted by the
pandemic, it should be expected that their opportunities to learn were disproportionately diminished, relative to their peers with more access and resources and less
stressful living conditions.
As a result of these constraints on opportunity to learn, the most vulnerable
students were more likely to disengage from school. Such disengagement is, in
effect, a form of school dropout, at least temporarily. As students fall behind because
of their lack of engagement, this further diminishes their motivation, leading to more
disengagement. It is possible that such a form of temporary dropout may lead to
permanent dropout as learners take on other roles, and as learning recovery and
catch up become more difficult as they fall further behind in terms of curricular
expectations. The children who drop out will add to the already large number of children out of school, 258 million in 2018 (UNESCO, 2018). UNESCO has estimated
that 24 million children are at risk of not returning to school (UNESCO, 2020a)
which would bring the total number of out of school children to the same level as
in the year 2000, in effect wiping out two decades of progress in educational access
(UNESCO, 2020c, 2). These estimates are based on the following likely processes:

1 Learning from a Pandemic. The Impact of COVID-19 …

29

(a) educational and socioemotional disengagement, (b) increased economic pressure,
and (c) health issues and safety concerns (UNESCO, 2020a).
In addition to the direct impact of the health and economic shocks on student
engagement, the lack of engagement of students was a function of the inadequacy of
government efforts to sustain education through alternative means and the circumstances of students. In Mexico, for instance, the Federal Ministry of Education in
Mexico closed schools on March 23, 2020; these closures remained in effect for at
least a year. When the academic year began on August 24, 2020, the government
deployed a national strategy for education continuity consisting of remote learning
through television, complemented by access to digital platforms such as Google and
local radio educational programming, with programs of teacher professional development on basic ICT skills to engage students remotely (World Bank, 2020c; SEP,
Boletín 101, 2020). A television strategy was adopted for education continuity during
the pandemic since only 56.4% of households have internet access, while 92.5%
have a television (INEGI, 2019) and Mexico has a long-standing program of TV
secondary school (Ripani & Zucchetti, 2020). Since March 2020, educational television content was delivered through Aprende en Casa I, II, and III (Learning at Home).
Some Mexican states complemented the national strategy with additional measures,
such as radio programs and textbook distribution, which were planned locally (World
Bank, 2020c). Indigenous communities were also reached in 15 indigenous languages
through partnerships with local radio networks (Ripani & Zucchetti, 2020). The
State of Quintana Roo, for example, which has a large Mayan population, produced
and distributed educational workbooks for students on various subjects written both
in Spanish and Mayan languages (SEQ, 2020). The State Secretary of Education
also created a YouTube channel with video lessons and a public television channel,
within Quintana Roo’s Social Communication system, that was solely dedicated to
the distribution of educational content (Gonzáles, 2020; Hinckley et al., 2021).
While the choice of a TV-based strategy for education continuity was predicated on
the almost universal accessibility to television, and on a long tradition of the Ministry
of Education producing educational TV (Telesecundaria), a survey conducted in June
2020 by an agency of the Mexican government showed that 57.3% of the students
lacked access to a computer, television, radio, or cell phone during the emergency
and 52.8% of the strategies required materials that students did not have in their
homes (MEJOREDU, 2020a). In the same survey, 51.4% of students reported that
the activities online, on the TV, and on radio programs were boring (MEJOREDU,
2020a). Students reported challenges to learning stemming from limited support or
lack of explanations from their teachers, lack of clarity in the activities they were
supposed to carry out, limited feedback on the work completed, lack of knowledge
about their successes or mistakes in the activities, insufficient understanding of what
they were doing, less learning and understanding, and perception of not having the
necessary knowledge to pass onto the next grade. More than half of the students
(60% at the primary level and 44% at the secondary level) indicated that during
the period of remote learning they had simply reviewed previously taught content
(MEJOREDU, 2020a).

30

F. M. Reimers

The same study canvassed teachers for their views on factors which prevented
student engagement, 84.6% of the teachers mentioned lack of internet access, 76.3%
mentioned lack of electronic devices to access activities, and 73.3% mentioned
limited economic resources (MEJOREDU, 2020a, p. 10). Students, in turn, reported
the following as factors which excluded them: difficulty in following the activities
(“it’s difficult,” “I don’t understand,” “I don’t have time”) followed by stress or frustration, the need to attend to housework, obligation to take care of other people, and lack
of motivation expressed as laziness, tiredness, boredom, loss of interest, or discouragement. Half of the students reported that the tasks involved in learning remotely
caused stress and 40% reported sadness and low levels of motivation (MEJOREDU,
2020a, p. 10).
Mexico’s approach to education continuity is illustrative of the approach followed
by many other countries. Costa Rica, for example, also closed down schools upon the
declaration of a national emergency in March 2020, transitioning to a virtual school
program, delivered through an online program, and a distance learning program
that varied throughout different cantons in the country (Diaz Rojas, 2020). These
were supplemented by an educational television program of two hours a day during
weekdays for students in the upper elementary grades, a daily one-hour radio program
augments these efforts. Five months after the initiation of the virtual strategy, 35%
of the students had not logged into the free online accounts provided to them by the
Ministry (Direccion de Prensa y Relaciones Publicas, 2020).
Bangladesh also closed schools on March 16th, 2020, and gradually extended
what was to be a two week lock down for at least a year, relying on a distance
learning strategy of education continuity relying on internet, TV, radio, and mobile
phones, which had serious challenges reaching students in a country where only 13%
of the population used the internet in 2019 and only 5.6% of households have access
to a computer (World Bank, 2019). Access to TV was greater, reaching 56% of the
households, but very few had access to radio (0.6% of the population). While access
to mobile phones was greater it was not universal, with 92% of families in the lowest
wealth quintile with access to mobile phones, but only 19% of the total population
with access to a smartphone (Bell et al., 2021; World Bank, 2019).
Some countries found the prospects of developing alternative forms of education continuity so daunting that they suspended the school year entirely. In Kenya,
for instance, by July of 2020 the Ministry of Education had decided to close all
public schools in the country until January 2021 and then restart the academic
school year. The decision was revised in October of 2020, with a partial reopening
of schools for the grades in which students take exams (grade 4, class 8, and form
4) in order to prepare students for the official school-leaving examinations and for
critical transitions (Voothaluru et al., 2021).
In South Africa, COVID-19 was met by wide-scale school closures, with no
practical way to shift to remote learning given lack of student access to the internet
(Statistics South Africa, 2019; UNICEF, 2020). In September 2020, schools reopened
after several months of being closed, only to close again in January 2021, during the
second wave of the pandemic (UNICEF, 2020).

1 Learning from a Pandemic. The Impact of COVID-19 …

Even well-resourced countries shifted to remote instruction for at least a short
period. In the United Arab Emirates, for instance, the Ministry of Education shifted
education to remote learning from March to June 2020. Upon resuming in-person
instruction at the start of the new academic year, however, families had the discretion
to choose whether to participate fully in-person, fully online, or in blended learning
modalities. In spite of the strong commitment to inclusion of people with disabilities
in the UAE, providing adequate accommodations for them was challenging (Mohajeri
et al., 2021).
Among the many challenges faced by schools and education systems, as they relied
on these alternative forms of educational continuity, was the assessment of students’
knowledge. Many national assessments were cancelled. Absence of information on
student knowledge and skills prevented determining the extent of learning loss and
the implementation of remedial programs to address it. Other challenges stemmed
from teachers’ limited skills in teaching remotely, as shown earlier.
While the lack of reliable assessments of learning loss to date prevent estimating
the full impact of the pandemic for most countries in the world, the limited studies
available document deep impacts, particularly for disadvantaged students. A recent
study conducted in Belgium, where schools were closed for approximately nine
weeks, shows significant learning losses in language and math (a decrease in school
averages of mathematics scores of 0.19 standard deviations and of Dutch scores
of 0.29 standard deviations as compared to the previous cohort) and an increase in
inequality in learning outcomes by 17% for math and 20% for Dutch, in part a result
of increases in inequality between schools (an increase in between school inequality
of 7% for math and 18% for Dutch). Losses are greater for schools with a higher
percentage of disadvantaged students (Maldonado, De Witte, 2020). A review of
this and seven additional empirical studies of learning loss, of which one focused
on higher education, finds learning loss also in the Netherlands, the United States,
Australia, and Germany, although the amount of learning loss is lower than in the
study in Belgium. A study in Switzerland finds learning loss to be insignificant and a
study in Spain finds learning gains during the pandemic (Donnelly & Patrinos, 2021,
149). These seven out of eight studies that identified learning loss were conducted
in countries where education systems were relatively well-resourced and covered
relatively short periods of school closures: 9 weeks in Belgium, 8 weeks in the
Netherlands, 8 weeks in Switzerland, 8–10 weeks in Australia, and 8.5 weeks in
Germany (Ibid). The studies also show that while there is consistent learning loss
for primary school students, this is not the case for secondary and higher education
students.
In addition to the losses in educational opportunity just described, there may be
some silver linings resulting from this global education calamity. The first is that
the interruption of schooling made visible how important teachers and schools are
to support learning, and how many other activities depend on the ability of schools
to carry out their role effectively. As teachers had to depend on parents to support
students in learning more than is habitual under regular circumstances, this may have
created valuable opportunities for mutual recognition between teachers and parents.
As each of these groups is now more cognizant of what the other does, perhaps they

32

F. M. Reimers

have learned to collaborate more effectively. Increased parental involvement in the
education of their children may have also strengthened important bonds and further
developed parenting skills. For some children, it is possible that the freedom from the
routines and constraints of schools, and from some of the social pressures resulting
from interaction with peers, may have provided opportunities to learn independently
and for greater focus, depth, and reflection.
The emergency also made visible the importance of attending to the emotional
well-being of students and showed that integrating this as part of the work of schools
is not only intrinsically valuable, but also part and parcel of a good education. In
attempting to provide emotional support to students, teachers also had to re-prioritize
the curriculum, engaging in a valuable exercise of rethinking what is truly important
for students to learn. Facing the challenge of reprioritizing the curriculum, some
countries embarked on a process of revision for the long haul.
For instance, the South African Directorate of Basic Education has taken a multipronged approach to address this complex set of issues. Two such approaches include
(1) A short-term—3 year—education recovery plan in response to COVID-19, to
address learning loss, and (2) A medium to long-term curriculum modernization plan
(2024 onward), aimed at addressing the issue of curriculum relevance and preparing
learners for the fast-changing world. The Directorate of Basic Education is working
with the National Education Collaboration Trust (NECT) to establish a CompetencyInfused Curriculum Task Team (CICTT) mandated to conceptualize and provide a
set of policy and implementation recommendations for a modernized curriculum
(Eadie et al., 2021).
Creating alternative forms of education delivery during the emergency provided
an opportunity for innovation and creativity, an opportunity that many teachers took
up, demonstrating outstanding professionalism. The organizational conditions which
unleashed such creativity and professionalism need to be better understood, as they
may represent a valuable dividend generated by this pandemic, which could be
usefully carried forward into the future.

1.9 Methods
To contribute to this book, in July of 2020 I invited colleagues from fifteen educational
institutions, the majority of whom are university-based researchers in a variety of
countries reflecting various regions of the world and varied education systems in
terms of the salient challenges facing those systems and the levels of education
spending across them. We agreed to conduct case studies that would analyze available
empirical evidence to address the questions below. The case studies were conducted
between August of 2020 and January of 2021. We then met at a virtual conference
in February of 2021 to discuss the draft chapters, and then finalized them by April
of 2021 based on feedback received from other contributors to the project.

When did the COVID-19 pandemic reach national attention in the country? Is
there a specific date when the government declared a national COVID-19 emergency? What educational policies followed that declaration? Was attendance
to school suspended? Where in the school year did this happen –was it the
beginning of the school year, the middle or the end?
What policy responses were adopted at various stages during the pandemic
to sustain educational opportunity? Were there alternative means of education
delivery created? Was the curriculum reprioritized? Were platforms for online
learning created? Educational radio? Television? Were there special efforts to
support the education of marginalized students?
What is known about the impact of the pandemic on educational opportunities in
the country, for different groups of students? Is there evidence on the degree to
which children remained enrolled in school, engaged in their studies, learning?
Are there any educational positive effects of the pandemic? Any silver linings?
Lessons learned that would be of benefit to education in the future.
What is known about the effects of the alternative means of delivery put in place,
if any?
Given current knowledge, what are the likely educational implications of the
pandemic?
What are the areas in which more research is needed?
What are areas that merit policy attention during the remaining period of the
pandemic, and beyond?

In addition to a chapter with a global focus, and a chapter comparatively examining
five OECD countries, the book includes chapters focusing on Brazil, Finland, Japan,
Mexico, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Spain, South Africa, and the United
States. A concluding chapter discusses some of the threads running through the cases
and the implications of the findings.
What follows is a rich and complex story. While most children of the world experienced some form of educational interruption, the extent and depth varied among
countries and among groups of children. Understanding the details of how education
systems were more able to preserve educational opportunity for some children and
in some countries is crucial to discern what was lost, what lies ahead, and what we
can expect from schools as institutions that can build a future that is better than the
present or the past.

Experiences with Risk-Management
and Remote Learning During
the COVID-19 Pandemic in Brazil:
Crises, Destitutions, and (Possible)
Resolutions
Claudia Costin and Allan Coutinho
Abstract The chapter examines the difficult conditions under which states, and
municipalities had to struggle to ensure learning continued during the social isolation
demanded by the COVID-19 crisis in the country. Although it seemed reasonable
to expect that the Federal government would respect the constitution and coordinate
the educational response to the pandemic, that simply did not happen. The Minister
of Education did not consider that such a responsibility should be carried out at
the federal level. In the absence of leadership from the central government, the
two organizations that congregate subnational secretaries decided to support their
members and promote the exchange of practices, with some support from civil society
organizations. Through the think tank established by the senior author of this chapter
at a private university, CEIPE- Center for Excellence and Innovation in Education
Policies, at the Getúlio Vargas Foundation, she participated in this effort, mentoring
state and municipal level secretaries in their efforts to provide distance learning
through a combination of media, such as TV, radio, and digital platforms. The chapter
includes her own anecdotal observations of this national effort, drawing on interviews
with secretaries and their teams as well as documents related to the experience as
the evidence basis of the chapter. Unfortunately, this is not a story of triumph, since
Brazil has been one of the countries with more months of schools being completely
or partially closed. In addition to the ineffective approach to fighting the disease,
which made Brazil’s rate of infection and deaths much worse than many countries in
Latin America, the fact that mayoral elections coincided with COVID-19, introduced
political reasons for schools to remain closed. The final part of the chapter draws
lessons learned and discusses future possibilities for the future of education in Brazil.

2.1 Introduction
Policymakers all over the world have perceived education as a volatile, uncertain,
complex, and ambiguous enterprise (See, for example, Fadel et al., 2015; Laukkoren
et al., 2018), for education cannot be detached from the broader conversations and
multifaceted developments driven by cultural, economic, and technological revolutions. Likewise, in both the Global North and the Global South, uncertainty has
become a vernacular of development, risk-management constituting the compass
through which governments and organizations prevent unforeseeable shocks and
mitigate systemic and unexpected threats (World Bank, 2014, pp. 11–13). Despite
acceptance that the human race has entered unprecedented territory and accepted
education as a complex enterprise, it has become clear that risk-management has
not been fully embraced to confront unforeseeable crises, such as the COVID-19
pandemic. These risk-management tenets have tremendous implications for policymaking in education and non-education spaces alike; risk management encompasses
the promotion of social insurance, coping and protection mechanisms, the spread of
reliable information, as well as decreasing losses resulting from disturbances in the
education sector and beyond (World Bank, 2014, p. 13). The surge of the COVID-19
pandemic and the disruptions that it has caused for educational systems have indeed
become a wake-up-call, not only in terms of the work that needed to be done for riskprevention, but for the work that lays ahead as we create effective learning conditions
for students who have been historically positioned in the margins, through policy and
practice, in a post-pandemic world.
In the context of the Global South Brazil stands as one of the countries in Latin
America that has had one of the least systematic responses to the pandemic, prioritizing economic activity over preventive measures, gridlocked by political turmoil
while relying on subnational levels of government to lead the efforts to combat the
pandemic (Mello, 2020a; World Bank, 2020a, p. 37). Having the opportunity to learn
from the experiences of other countries, such as China and Italy, which had already
been impacted by first-wave infections by the end of February 2020 (Plümper &
Neumayer, 2020), the federal government in Brazil was reluctant to take preventive
measures to contain the spread of the virus and support local educational systems to
deal with novel situations and deep uncertainties, as well as cope with systemic crises.
This chapter provides a description of such developments between March 2020 and
January 2021, and highlights the complementary roles of civil society organizations,
the private sector, and the international community in strengthening risk-management
to promote learning during school closures in Brazil. It also highlights the role of
the state/public sector in advancing formal mechanisms to ensure that efforts aligned
with the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number 4 are sustained to promote
quality and equity in education—the promotion of equal opportunities across several
dimensions of diversity such as gender, sex, race, ethnicity, etc.
Written in a chronological order, this chapter is structured in three major sections.
In the first section, titled “Education and its discontents with COVID-19 in Brazil,”
we set the context examining policy, distance learning, curriculum, and teaching.

2 Experiences with Risk-Management and Remote Learning …

41

We briefly describe the governance structure of the Brazilian educational systems,
as delineated by the 1988 Brazilian constitution and the 1996 National Education
Law (Lei de Diretrizes e Bases da Educação, or LDB) and portray the political
milieu that has driven policy decisions pertaining to curriculum and teaching at
national and subnational levels, starting in March 2020 up to July 2020. To further
qualify the discussions, Claudia Costin, the senior author, the Director of the Center
for Excellence and Innovation in Education Policies (CEIPE), includes her own
anecdotal reflections on the national effort drawing on her mentoring experiences
with state and municipal secretaries of education as they began to provide distance
learning through a combination of media channels such as TV, radio, and digital
platforms. In the second section, titled “The variance of responses against COVID19,” we synthesize data from qualitative and mixed methods research gathered by notfor-profit, civil society, government, and private organizations in Brazil, especially
from July 2020 onwards, to shed light on stakeholders’ perspectives on such policy
responses with a focus on equity. In this section, we also underscore the growing
tensions raised in the second semester of 2020 when certain subnational levels of
government attempted to gradually reopen schools. We argue that the shocks on the
educational system caused by COVID-19 have (and will) inequitably hinder growth
and development in Brazil. Finally, in the concluding section titled “Planting seeds
of hope in shaken terrain,” we briefly elaborate on steps that can help the country
advance its development agenda in times of recovery.
In this chapter, we provide insights for educational policy formulation and research
by considering risk-management tenets while considering the colonial histories of a
nation-state such as Brazil. Until very recently, race was absent in discussions about
social policy in the country (Todaro & Smith, 2015, p. 34; Reid, 2014, p. 181), but
this is rapidly changing due to heinous acts of violence against Black and Indigenous
communities in Brazil and abroad. This has raised awareness about discrimination
and further galvanized public action from long-standing, anti-racist grassroot movements, as well as organizations which now have become even more active in questioning and addressing the roots of systemic oppression (See, for example, Cruz &
Vicente, 2020; Instituto Unibanco, 2020; Westin, 2020; Kim Abe, 2020). We write
this essay attuned to these pivotal developments and provide insights about educational policy with an intersectional lens, not only to promote social justice in a very
unequal landscape such as Brazil, but also as a sine qua non of discourses on development focused on freedom (Sen, 1999). Given the scope of this book and space
constraints, this chapter is a synopsis of both struggles and successes in delivering
educational opportunities during these unprecedented times in Brazil.

2.2 Education and Its Discontents with COVID-19
in Brazil: When the Wave of Uncertainty Hits
the Hardest, Risk-Management Needs to Be in Place
Brazil is home to a complex system of educational governance guided by several laws
which determine the shapes and contours of the enterprise. As per the 1988 Brazilian
constitution and the 1966 National Education Law (Brazil, 1996), the federal, state,
and municipal governments are bestowed divergent yet complementary responsibilities. For example, the federal government, through the Ministry of Education
(MEC), has been assigned the responsibility to create a National Plan for Education (Plano Nacional de Educação) to set normative guidelines for policymaking at
both state and municipal levels, playing a distributive, financial, and advisory role.
By the same token, states, and municipalities, through a system of collaboration
and with the support from the federal government, have been given the authority to
offer compulsory education for all, from early childhood to upper secondary education. In this capacity, municipalities offer early childhood education, primary and
lower secondary education (in the International Standard Classification of Education, levels 0, 1 and 2), whereas state governments become responsible to offer lower
and, most importantly, upper secondary education (in the International Standard
Classification of Education, 2 and 3). Meanwhile, the federal government became
primarily responsible to offer tertiary education. With 26 states, a Federal District,
and 5,568 municipalities, coherence is paramount to provide resources and sustain
equitable learning at all levels of education and to advance the Sustainable Development agenda proposed by the United Nations. After all, educational processes
are a complex enterprise, especially in a federation; it requires systematic management strategies among federal and subnational government spheres to plan for a
robust national strategy for education, one which can overcome structural barriers
and administering unforeseeable shocks.
Despite evidence that collaboration among national and subnational levels governments can bring positive educational outcomes in a federation such as Brazil (Abrucio
et al., 2016; Carnoy et al., 2017; World Bank, 2017, p. 5; Loureiro et al., 2020, pp. 9–
11), cooperation between federal and subnational systems has deteriorated as new
waves of uncertainty brought by the COVID-19 pandemic materialized. The major
newspapers in the country began to spread information about the new virus back in
January 2020 (Folha de São Paulo, 2020) when the world started to learn about the
public health situation in Wuhan, China. By the end of February 2020, other nations
in Europe had already begun to experience first-wave infections. Brazil, on the other
hand, started to report its first cases consisting of upper-middle class travelers who
had visited European countries and had been exposed to the new virus (Pescarini
et al., 2020; Oliveira, 2020; Ministry of Health, 2020a). In the beginning of March,
the World Health Organization (WHO) classified the outbreak as a global pandemic.
Concerns regarding community transmission among the most vulnerable—particularly people living in remote regions or in the slums of Brazil who would not have the
basic means (e.g., water and soap) to protect themselves and their families—gained

2 Experiences with Risk-Management and Remote Learning …

43

prevalence in the country (Ribeiro, 2020). Contrary to the upper-middle class, who
had access to basic sanitary goods and enjoyed greater mobility due to lower household densities while abiding to social distancing measures, lower-income households
struggled to follow risk-management procedures determined by health authorities.
For example, in the city of Rio de Janeiro, the household density in the dwelling
favelas is greater compared to affluent regions (Rio de Janeiro Prefecture, 2016;
Observatório SEBRAE, 2015). Despite advancements with social policies such
as Bolsa Família, a conditional cash transfer (CCT) program highly esteemed
by the international community (Lindert et al, 2007), the vacuum of government
authority, political interference, corruption, and large-scale bureaucracy, among other
commonly perceived iterative elements of ineffective-governance, continued to sabotage the development of the country in the education sector and beyond (See, for
example, Akhtari et al., 2014; Saunders, 2016; Lisboa & Latif, 2013; Machoski &
Araujo, 2020). With a Gini coefficient of 0,6391 (Ministry of Health, 2010)—an
aggregate numerical measure which portrays income inequality in a scale of 0 to
1, from perfect equality to perfect inequality, respectively—the degree of inequality
is still a conspicuous feature of the intersectional social fabric of the city across
different dimensions of diversity including race, sex, and gender. These discrepancies are also representative of the national landscape, evident not only in terms of
relative income disparities across several dimensions of diversity, but also in relation to other human development indicators such as the Inequality-adjusted Human
Development Index (IHDI) and the Gender Inequality Index (GII) (UNDP, 2018).
Predictably, the population positioned at the periphery, mostly composed of People
of Color and Indigenous peoples, would be impacted the most by the COVID-19
pandemic, thus exacerbating historical inequalities in Brazil.
Public outcry targeted at such systemic and intersectional inequalities, as well as
concerns with the fate of an already collapsing economy before the global pandemic,
led the federal government to issue a decree on March 18th, 2020 to establish a state
of calamity in Brazil. Between March 17th and March 18th, the Ministry of Education
(MEC) released its first official statements concerning the pandemic: (i) an ordinance
(ordinance nº 343) permitting the employment of distance learning at scale in tertiary
institutions throughout the course of the pandemic (Brazil, 2020) and (ii) a media
release providing advice to post-graduate students who studied abroad on national
scholarships about financial matters and travel restrictions (MEC, 2020a). By March
20th, 2020, the federal decree was approved on the floor of the Senate, in its first
online session, thus uplifting public health expenditure restrictions to contain the
spread of the virus and combat the economic and social effects of the pandemic
nationwide (Planalto, 2020). By the same token, state and municipal governments
started to enact decrees of calamity and emergency which impacted both public
and private spheres, including the educational sector, which had recently started
the school year. Each state in Brazil, followed by municipalities, enacted measures
to prevent the spread of the new virus. In Table 1 of the Appendix, we provide a
list of the first decrees and normative measures enacted by every state in Brazil,
including the Federal District. Within 10 days, between March 14th and March 23rd,
in the first stage of the pandemic, all states in Brazil issued legislative and normative

44

C. Costin and A. Coutinho

measures to close public and private schools. Most subnational levels of government
optimistically determined that schools would be closed for a period of 15 or 30 days
and that these days would later supplant the mid-year school vacation, thus preventing
major disruptions in the school calendar.

2.3 The Loss of Instructional Time and the Sense
of Urgency to Mitigate COVID-19 Shocks
According to a study conducted by Barbara Bruns and Javier Luque, Brazil already
loses approximately one day of weekly class instruction due to classroom management issues, dysfunctional relational dynamics in classrooms, etc. (Bruns & Luque,
2014). Understanding the importance of learning for economic participation and
as one dimension of/for citizenship,1 as well as the positive correlations between
teacher quality, curriculum, instruction and learning (e.g. Darling-Hammond, 2000;
Morshed et al., 2010; Blömeke et al., 2016), concerns regarding the status of these
levers of change have grown in policy circles across Brazil, especially after results
from national and international evaluations such as the Programme for International
Student Assessment (PISA) have become available (Reid, 2014, pp. 175–178). One
would imagine that such concerns would drive the response to the pandemic, as a
matter of urgency, in our national agenda, for continuity of learning can be decisive in
promoting better opportunities for students placed at-risk under systems of oppression and dispossession. However, under the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro, the Minister
of Education (MEC) Abraham Weintraub shirked responsibilities to coordinate the

1 Conceptions of citizenship are various (e.g. critical citizenship, global citizenship, waitcitizenship) and arguably determined (See, for example, Andreotti, 2006; Reimers, 2016; Bellino,
2018). Yet, despite a plethora of conceptions, learning—commonly perceived as the acquirement,
development and honing of skills, knowledge and dispositions—constitutes a dimension of/for citizenship across various discourses. What seemingly differs among various discourses is whether and
how learning is linked and positioned in relation to other dimensions of citizenship such as agency,
and how it is located in relation to other expected processes and outcomes of education (See, for
example, Pinar, 2019, for a critical discussion on curriculum and the site of education). The authors
recognize that learning, be it primarily linked to economic participation or not, constitutes a dimension of/for citizenship in knowledge economies—as a means to civic and economic participation,
integration, recognition, etc. As such, learning can promote human dignity and freedoms, at least
within certain parameters: as long as (i) such learning is equitably distributed across intersectional
spectrums of diversity, taking into account unjust systems of (re)distribution, and (ii) not used as a
justification to promote deficit-thinking discourses about specific identities and populations (For a
historical discussion on deficit-thinking in the global-north context, see Valencia, 1997).

national response against COVID-19 in the educational sector.2 His approach undermined risk-management sharing among key development actors and left a vacuum
which had to be immediately filled to overcome prevailing losses with the interruption
of schooling activities. Subnational levels of government—strongly represented by
organizations such as the Brazilian Council of Educational Secretaries (CONSED)
and the National Union of Municipal Directors of Education (UNDIME)—with the
aid of civil society organizations, the private sector, and the international community,
began to join efforts to strengthen risk-management strategies to combat food insecurity and prevent learning disruptions throughout the course of the pandemic. Through
uniting, they worked with celerity to deliver services at scale so that every student
could at least have access to some form of distance education, a proxy for face-toface learning, and conditions to feed themselves—basic rights which are considered
pivotal constituent components of development as freedom in a democracy.
Alarmed at the developments in Brazil and abroad, the director of CEIPE-FGV,
Claudia Costin, one of the authors of this chapter, began to work with her team
to support secretaries of education to minimize the shocks originated from school
closures while observing international responses to the pandemic. One of the major
goals of CEIPE-FGV is to prepare leadership to address the most pernicious issues
in the educational sector of Brazil (CEIPE-FGV, 2020), from shifting the usual
“crisis-fighter” approach to management in education to a sustained, proactive, and
systematic risk approach to leadership—one which (i) understands the contextually
regulative, normative, cultural-cognitive and racial dimensions/dynamics of institutional reforms and which (ii) acts upon these dimensions, in collaboration with
other development actors, to plan and promote quality and equitable learning beyond
one’s four-year electoral tenure, at all levels of education. Fundação Getulio Vargas
(FGV), the tertiary institution that houses the organization, has also been proactive
in supporting the spread of reliable information and resources to aid the response to
2 Abraham Weintraub held office as Minister of Education from April 9th, 2020, to June 19th,

2020. His administration became the target of scathing criticisms from educational pundits and
policymakers after controversial statements and ineffective management strategies (Alvarenga &
Parreira, 2020a; b). Although the Ministry of Education convened, on March 2020, during the first
stage of the pandemic, with the Brazilian Council of Educational Secretariats (CONSED) and the
National Union of Municipal Directors of Education (UNDIME) to discuss the flexibilization of the
200 school-day calendar, a standard established by LDB, as well as the maximum workload offered
in distance education (MEC, 2020b), coordination seemed elusive and policies incongruent with
the social landscape of Brazil. For example, the Minister of Education was reluctant to postpone the
Brazilian National High School Evaluation (ENEM) (Vieira, 2020)—a compulsory standardized
exam of students’ knowledge and skills which serves as a classificatory tool for college entrance
nationwide—despite the inequities that this would cause given the divergent learning conditions
offered to different populations of learners across the nation. Concerned with the status of the
response to the pandemic, the National Education Counsel (CNE)—an autonomous advisory body
within MEC mostly composed of appointed scholars and educational specialists—issued an opinion
on April 28th, 2020 (CNE, Opinion nº 5/2020), after a period of public consultation and in accordance with the federal provisional measure nº 934 of April 1st, 2020. Partially ratified by the Minister,
the CNE’s opinion addressed questions pertaining to the organization of the school calendar and the
possibility of including non face-to-face classroom activities in order to comply with the minimum
annual workload established by national legislation.

the pandemic (Costin et al., Forthcoming). At CEIPE-FGV, Costin has personally
mentored fifty-three secretaries of education—fifty municipal level secretaries and
three state level secretaries—and has worked closely with them to respond to distinct
crises and shocks before and during the pandemic.
Institutionally, CEIPE-FGV has compiled and translated documents to share reliable information and practices from national and international educational systems
while accounting for intricacies of local context, and promoted several webinars
with the support of Instituto República (https://republica.org) to aid the response
of secretaries of education across Brazil (e.g. Costin, 2020a; Melnick & DarlingHammond 2020; FGV, 2020). Practically, all involved in this work at CEIPE-FGV
were cognizant that knowledge-sharing was just one side of a complex web of
strategies to strengthen risk-management, avoid dropouts, and promote learning
in adversity. After all, several structural barriers such as lack of internet connectivity in households and teacher preparedness (e.g., the extent to which teachers
feel comfortable/trained to use technology) could jeopardize the response to the
pandemic. Indeed, data collected prior to the pandemic highlighted, for example, (i)
discrepancies between households with internet access in urban versus rural areas
(70% vs. 44%, respectively) (CETIC, 2019), and (ii) a large percentage of teachers
(60–70%) who felt a high need to hone skills in Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) (World Bank, 2020b, p. 112). These were simple statistics that
depicted a tiny proportion of the challenges that we would face in sustaining education opportunities across diverse communities throughout the course of the pandemic
in Brazil, but a reality which could have not prevented leaders from acting.

2.4 New Means of Instruction and Curriculum
Reprioritization in the COVID-19 Context
As the end of the first two weeks of lockdown neared, awareness spread that the
pandemic would last for as long as a vaccine would be made available, all states
and municipalities started to issue other decrees and normative measures to expand
the period of school closures. As a result, subnational governments and development organizations from several sectors began to rethink (i) the means of instruction,
advocating for mixed approaches to teaching and learning at different stages of education and, consequently, (ii) the scope and delivery of the formal curriculum in the
COVID-19 context, as well as (iii) preemptive strategies to facilitate the restoration of
face-to-face classes. From the outset, one of the first measures was to evaluate which
resources subnational governments had at their disposal (e.g., online platforms, radio
and TV channels, capabilities to support the delivery of lessons and homework, etc.),
or which assets they could allocate to either create or strengthen these systems of
coping and protection to ensure that education would not be interrupted in a state
of calamity. Such concerns were paramount to discussions concerning mitigation
and educational opportunity in the second stage of our response to the COVID-19

2 Experiences with Risk-Management and Remote Learning …

47

pandemic during April, May, and June 2020. At CEIPE-FGV, speaking with secretaries of education in our mentorship program, we began to think strategically about
how educational systems could combine different modes of delivery and instruction
to ensure that losses would be mitigated, especially at crucial stages of human development (e.g., during the first years of ISCED level 1 when children learn and hone
their literacy skills, and in the last year of ISCED level 3 when youth begin to transition to tertiary education). We also evaluated how to maintain the supply of school
lunches by giving staple basic products to families, etc. Moreover, we promoted
communication amongst stakeholders, engaging secretaries to support teachers in
their professional development and encouraging them to connect to parents via telephone and social media using apps such as WhatsApp and Instagram, with special
attention to households that had children with special educational needs.
For instance, in the city of Boa Vista, the capital of the state of Roraima, Brazil,
the vice-mayor and secretary of education, Arthur Henrique, was already responding
to unforeseeable developments in the educational sector as a result of a humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, receiving immigrants from our neighboring country and
adopting measures to make their transition to Brazil less traumatic (e.g. elaborating
and applying examinations in Spanish so that learning could be sustained and immigrants’ identities maintained) (Costin, 2020b). The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated
risks in several dimensions, especially the social and emotional, which are the basis
of a holistic education and key factors for human flourishing. Mitigating additional
hindrances caused by the pandemic, the secretary consulted teachers, who had already
begun to propose activities to students, and created a new system wide initiative
called “Boa Vista Learns at Home” (Boa Vista Aprendendo em Casa). The secretary
designed and offered a formal, malleable curriculum that could be adapted by teachers
while prioritizing key knowledge and skills aligned with Brazil’s National Common
Core, translating it into lesson plans and sharing these resources via Instagram
(https://www.instagram.com/aprendendoemcasabv/?hl=en) and WhatsApp (Chaves,
2020).
Based on the premise that through new channels of delivery the full scope of the
formal curriculum could no longer be achieved, that educational experience would
be circumscribed; policymakers and educators began to take stock of a new form of
curriculum-as-plan. Brazil has very recently designed, approved, and begun to implement its first National Common Core, BNCC (Base Nacional Comum Curricular)
making it a norm that all children across all dimensions of diversity in all regions of
Brazil enjoy the same learning rights while respecting the intricacies of local context
(for more information regarding the curriculum reform, see Costin & Pontual, 2020).
This has been an ambitious reform focused on equity and learning, operated within
the parameters proposed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in its competence-based framework. The COVID-19 pandemic
brought ambiguity to how our formal curriculum would be executed in an unanticipated context—at all levels of compulsory education and under considerable time
and structural constraints. In this context, curriculum ﬂexibilization and prioritization became the terminology that guided the translation of BNCC expectations into
COVID-19 contextual learning priorities in the city of Boa Vista and beyond.

48

C. Costin and A. Coutinho

Indeed, at the national level, the ongoing curriculum question “What knowledge
is of most worth” became even more accentuated as curriculum specialists continued
to grapple with the task of prioritizing knowledge and curricular content while facing
a global health crisis. At that time, the Brazilian not-for-profit organization, Instituto Reúna (https://institutoreuna.org.br), noticing disparities between BNCC’s high
expectations and the knowledge possessed by students, had already begun to design
“learning maps” aligned with BNCC’s learning rights (https://institutoreuna.org.
br/projeto/mapas-de-foco-bncc/). Departing from a behavioral, knowledge-based
approach and from a contextual diagnosis of students’ capabilities, these “learning
maps” would serve as compass to help leaders, pedagogical coordinators and teachers
reprioritize their formal curricula by connecting specific knowledge and skills across
areas of knowledge (e.g., Languages and Sciences) and levels of education (ISCED
level 2 and 3). These “learning maps” differentiated learning in three categories:
‘focal,’ ‘complementary’ and ‘expectations for fluency,’ the latter only available
in the curricula components of Portuguese and Mathematics. The ‘focal learning’
is considered non-negotiable, deemed necessary for the development of the child
(e.g., skills related to literacy development and writing), whereas learning in the
‘complementary’ and ‘fluency’ domains offer opportunities for further development
and mastery, the latter representing a stage where students mobilize ‘objects of
knowledge’ and ‘skills’ paramount for a specific level of education (Casagrande,
2020). Utilizing this method, educational systems are then supported to select and
design curriculum content, didactic material, sequences, and lesson plans, as well
as consider appropriate evaluation methods by considering their contextual needs
during COVID-19. These “learning maps” have also been promoted by CONSED
and UNDIME, institutions that galvanized cooperation from public, private, supranational and philanthropic organizations, including a research center at a public
university, the Center for Public Policies and Evaluation in the Federal University of
Juiz de Fora (CAEd/UFJF), to create an online platform titled “Supporting Learning”
(Portuguese: Apoio à Aprendizagem) available at https://apoioaaprendizagem.caeddi
gital.net/#!/pagina-inicial. Over seven thousand users have accessed this platform,
which has offered resources, including Instituto Reúna’s learning maps, to guide
mitigation strategies throughout the course of the pandemic, including resources for
when face-to-face classes resume.

2.5 The Variance of Responses Against COVID-19
and the Waning of Learning and Participation
At that stage in our response to mitigate COVID-19, when subnational levels of
government had already begun to implement their coping strategies, a need to understand the variance of responses in the educational sector arose to qualify policy
deliberations. Several organizations started to collect data from multiple stakeholders—education secretaries, students, parents, and teachers—from March 2020

2 Experiences with Risk-Management and Remote Learning …

49

onwards, thus facilitating discussions about risk-management, equity, and learning.
The research available provided some encouraging information, but it also highlighted woeful discrepancies regarding risk-management strategies that aimed to
sustain educational opportunity and wellness across Brazil, concerns directly related
to the United Nations’ 2030 Sustainable Development agenda. For example, the
research project “Education Cannot Wait” —See second table in the Appendix where
we synthesize data from some of these research initiatives—indicated that 93% of
municipal respondents had aligned their pedagogical interventions with BNCC’s
learning rights, thus preventing further delays to translate BNCC’s orientations into
pedagogical interventions once face-to-face classes resume. Regarding discrepancies, the research projects “Feelings and Perceptions of Brazilian Teachers” and
“Youth and the COVID-19 Pandemic” highlighted a percentage difference, albeit
not from representative samples, between male and female respondents regarding
their perceptions on wellness, which can raise several hypotheses about gender
disparities. Moreover, the research project “Education Cannot Wait” and “Distance
Education, Wave 1” underscored regional incongruencies regarding access to formal
education in the COVID-19 context. In some cases, municipalities could employ
in-place mechanisms to cope and sustain educational opportunity. There were also
cases where municipalities mobilized new resources to implement brand new strategies. For instance, in the city of Senador Canedo in the state of Goiás, in addition
to using YouTube and radio channels to offer distance education, the department
handed out USB drives with pre-loaded activities to students who had computers
at home, but no access to the internet. The department also created its own online
domain (http://www.semecsenadorcanedo.com.br) to share information with stakeholders throughout the course of the pandemic and registered students and teachers
in Google classroom (Faria et al., 2020, pp. 9–10).
The research project “Education Cannot Wait” pointed out that opportunities for
access were indeed greater in the South and Southeast regions of Brazil among
municipalities that had participated in the survey. This finding is interesting because
it aligns with the data provided by the World Bank in its index of “student vulnerability” to school closures (World Bank, 2020b, p. 113). The construct of “vulnerability”
has been calculated based on five variables— (i) availability of meals at school, (ii)
usage of technology by educators in classrooms, (iii) family engagement, (iv) number
of students who work, and (v) past dropouts—and indicates vulnerability from 0 to
1, from less vulnerable to critically vulnerable, respectively (World Bank, 2020b,
p. 113). Only one state from the North/Northeast regions was represented in the
group of six states, plus the Federal District, positioned below the national average
(0,495) in student vulnerability. Conversely, all states positioned towards the tip of
the curve in “critical vulnerability” were represented by states in the North/Northeast
regions. These statistics demonstrate a historical fact regarding states’ and municipalities’ divergent regional capacities to offer educational opportunity in Brazil—a
deed which encouraged federal and subnational levels of government to create and
maintain the Primary and Secondary Education Maintenance and Development Fund
(FUNDEB), a collective financial mechanism that amasses resources amongst subnational levels of government to subsequently share them with contributors based on

50

C. Costin and A. Coutinho

their weighted number of students across different levels of education, from ISCED
level 0 to ISCED level 5 (Todos Pela Educação, 2020).
Regional disparities are important in denouncing equity disparities in the country.
Like analyses that link zip codes to poverty indexes, these statistics demonstrate
that privileges rather than rights have constituted the making of democratic Brazil,
that unearned advantages continue to travel across space to offer better opportunities
to some segments of the population. However, despite its relevance, such statistics can only denounce a facet of inequality; statistics can only tell so much about
the face of injustice because they lack a human dimension. In fact, these statistics
alone can end up shifting the focus from pivotal constitutive dimensions of oppression, while bolstering discourses that are color-blind and fail to denounce disparities
across dimensions of diversity. Most often, they have the capacity to hide the societal engineering that has shaped Brazilian culture and the historical forces that have
fabricated lives, such as the deep, troubling colonial histories that forged the making
of democratic Brazil (See Ribeiro, 2000, for a historical analysis concerning the
formation of Brazil). Thus, in verifying whether equity constitutes the foundation of
an educational system and whether freedoms constitute the core of development, we
find it pivotal to view data through an intersectional lens to understand how different
dimensions of diversity (such as race, class, and gender) come together to enact
different kinds of privileges and levels of freedoms in our democracy.
In this regard, the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE)
conducted a pivotal initiative during the first stages of the pandemic by collecting
household data via phone calls on a monthly basis, from May to November, as part of
its National Household Sample Survey (Pnad), available at https://COVID19.ibge.
gov.br/pnad-COVID/. Aiming to estimate the number of people with COVID-19
symptoms and quantify some of the impacts on the labor market (IBGE, 2020a), the
applied questionnaire of July–October 2020 collected information regarding individuals’ gender, ethnicity, age, etc. It also provided data regarding school/university
enrollments and whether individuals had been offered any form of distance education
activity (e.g., online classes and homework) during the first stages of the response to
the pandemic (IBGE, 2020b). This data provides a glimpse of how lives are differently
(re)produced in contexts where “rights” are sustained for a few; it shows important
disparities between those who had been granted access to formal education during
the pandemic—in this case, offered some form of distance education—and those
who did not.
The Research and Training Nucleus on Race, Gender and Social Justice of the
Brazilian Center for Analysis and Planning (Afro-CEBRAP), one of the first organizations to draft reports using Pnad COVID-19 data, highlighted that the proportion
of the population of non-White students (Black, Brown and Indigenous people) who
participated in educational activities in June 2020, was extremely low compared to
the White student population (White and people of Asian descent) across all regions
of Brazil, in addition to disparities in internet access, health insurance, etc. (See
Prates, 2020; Lima et al., 2020; Venturini et al., 2020). This information corroborates recent research that suggested that structural barriers and biases/prejudices
against communities of color have shaped the lives of these individuals in classrooms

2 Experiences with Risk-Management and Remote Learning …

51

and beyond. For example, these structural factors have affected the performance of
Black students in the Brazilian Basic Education Evaluation System (SAEB) (Iede,
2020) and increased the likelihood of getting infected and dying by COVID-19 in
Brazil (Baqui et al., 2020). Indigenous communities have also been greatly impacted
by COVID-19 (Dias & Leonel, 2020). The new virus has become an imminent risk to
elders—the “guardians of memory” (Bergamaschi & Medeiros, 2010, p. 63) responsible to transmit wisdom and knowledge across generations—and, consequently, a
threat to traditional knowledge and Indigenous education (Milhorance, 2020).

2.6 The Attempt to Gradually Reopen Schools to Avoid
Further Losses: The Contentious Site of Education
With growing concerns about intersectional and generational disparities, in the last
semester of 2020, from July onwards, some decision makers became more attuned
to global developments as international data regarding school openings circulated
within policy circles. At that time, the OECD had released its Education at a Glance
report comparing the loss of instructional time between OECD and partner countries.
The duration of school closures ranged from 7 to 19 weeks, with Brazil falling in
a runner-up position with a total of 16 weeks of closure (OECD, 2020, p. 359), a
fact that raised concerns about students’ mental health and their ability to continue
participating in formal education. By the same token, Brazilian organizations also
collected and shared data concerning decisions to reopen schools in several countries
while observing health mandates in both Global North and South contexts, reporting
whether COVID-19 infections increased, decreased, or remained constant as a function of schools’ decisions to reopen (See, for example, Vozes da Educação, 2020).
Unfortunately, however, the amount of reliable information shared with stakeholders
did not seem to match the rate of coordination or the rate in which new educational
policies were implemented to circumvent the loss of instructional time.
Without national coordination in a decentralized system and engulfed by
contentious discourses that either lambasted or praised those who advocated for
the implementation of sustainable plans to reopen schools and safeguard educational
opportunity, the country maintained a stark, heterogeneous response to the pandemic.
According to a survey distributed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in that same period, some states had begun
to plan to gradually reopen schools by (i) designing a calendar to allow different
groups of students to attend face-to-face classes on specific days; (ii) creating school
shifts opposite to regular school hours; and (iii) prioritizing certain levels of education such as Early Childhood Education (ECE) (UNESCO, 2020). By employing
these and other programs, educational leaders aimed to sustain educational opportunity, decrease the number of students per class so as not to overcrowd classes in
the future and, therefore, decrease the rate of school and out-of-school infections.
Notwithstanding, there were also educational systems that had no plans in place to

52

C. Costin and A. Coutinho

resume face-to-face classes and offer hybrid education in the new COVID-19 context
(UNESCO, 2020).
This heterogeneous response was not, however, only a product of deficient coordination or the fact that different geographic regions experienced divergent rates of
infection, but also the result of several opinions that prioritized the short-term benefits of economic activity over the long-term beneficial effects of continued education.
Contrary to other educational systems around the world which prioritized schooling
and education as a human right, Brazil predominantly chose to facilitate the trade
of goods and services by opening not only shopping malls, but also pubs and bars
in lieu of schools. This conspicuous trend exposed the status of education in our
national agenda in both times of prosperity and risk sharing. Moreover, divergent
technical opinions discouraged plans to reopen schools, arguing that such measures
would put the health of the population in jeopardy (See, for example, Fiocruz, 2020).
Dissonances in public opinion were evident during this period—an estimated 76%
of Brazilians adamantly rejected plans to resume face-to-face classes or implement
hybrid modes of education (Datafolha & Folha de S. Paulo, 2020). It also incited
teachers to advocate for better sanitary and working conditions, as well as call for
inclusion in the first group to receive vaccines, whenever these would be made
available.3
On the one hand, these social developments demanded greater attention from
mayors and secretaries of education to democratically engage in public deliberations
before enacting any reopening plans, especially considering new municipal elections.
On the other hand, they catalyzed seemingly incongruous programs and responses
across the country. For example, in the State of São Paulo, the governor issued
separate decrees in July and August 2020, decrees 65.016 and 65.061 respectively,
authorizing schools to optionally and gradually reopen insofar as state and local
health procedures were followed (São Paulo’s State Legislative House, 2020a, b).
Nevertheless, according to national media outlets, adherence among municipalities
in the state were low because of public scrutiny and distrust: as of December 6th,
2020, only 219 out of 645 municipalities joined these efforts (Mello, 2020b). In the
city of Rio de Janeiro, another interesting development happened, for the state and the
municipality diverged in their normative measures. The city of Rio de Janeiro issued a
statement allowing private schools to resume classes optionally and gradually in early
August for certain grades of primary and lower secondary education. According to the
mayor, this would serve as a trial that would later inform decisions to reopen public
schools (Rio de Janeiro Prefecture, 2020). However, public prosecution brought forth
a case to the judiciary system against this provision, citing other decrees issued by
the state legislature that had promulgated school reopenings to a later date, while
alleging that the mayor’s decision would be in detriment of the common good: not
3 The immunization plan issued by the Ministry of Health in December 2020 initially positioned
educators in the fourth category within its priority group, the last category to receive vaccines before
ordinary citizens (Ministry of Health, 2020b). Even before the plan was announced, civil society and
international organizations as well as other institutions from private and public sectors, including
teacher unions, campaigned to include teachers in the first categories of the priority group (See, for
example, UNDIME, 2020).

2 Experiences with Risk-Management and Remote Learning …

53

only could it create disparities between private and public systems, but it could also
increase the rate of COVID-19 infections (Public Prosecution Office in the State of
Rio de Janeiro, 2020a, b). The judiciary system later maintained that private schools
would remain closed in the city (Judiciary system in the state of Rio de Janeiro, 2020),
a decision that was later overruled by that same judicial system (Castro, 2020).
As the last months of 2020 ended these contentious debates did not cease but
rather became a focal point of national debate. For example, in early January, the
United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) office in Brazil issued a letter to the
5,568 elected mayors pleading for their support to put education first and prioritize reopening plans in their administrative agendas (UNICEF, 2020). These calls
were backed up by new research that evaluated the effects of country-wide school
closures on learning and the development of knowledge and skills at national and
international levels (See, for example, Kuhfeld et al, 2020; Agostinelli et al., 2020).
At that time, policymakers had not only information regarding who had the most
access to schooling activities, but also estimations of how such disparities in access
would translate into learning losses. In Brazil specifically, another coalition between
a research center at Fundação Getulio Vargas, the Center for Learning on Evaluation
and Results for Brazil and Lusophone Africa (FGV EESP Clear), and the Lemann
Foundation, a not-for-profit organization that has fostered several education partnerships throughout the years, produced evidence regarding learning losses in the
Brazilian context. Using a methodology employed by the World Bank in its report
“Simulating the potential impacts of COVID-19 school closures on schooling and
learning outcomes: a set of global estimates” and retrieving data from SAEB, the
researchers estimated significant learning losses for students in lower and upper
secondary education. In a worst-case scenario, compared to a typical schooling year,
FGV EESP Clear estimated a 72% loss in learning for lower secondary students.
In an optimistic scenario, the estimate would constitute a loss of 14%. Similarly,
for upper secondary students, the estimates were 72% and 15%, respectively (FGV
EESP Clear, 2020, p. 6).
In addition to estimated learning losses, dropouts have also constituted an issue of
paramount importance for Brazil: an estimated number of four million students, ages
6–34, abandoned schools in 2020 because of COVID-19 related issues (C6 Bank,
2021). In a country where the opportunity cost of attending schools has been disproportionately high for students at risk, shocks such as this one can seriously alter one’s
life trajectory. Knowing that dropping out of school can affect students’ self-esteem
and impose long-term barriers to return to school, these numbers set a concerning
path for Brazil and raise a red flag for our recovery strategies. Hence, despite collective efforts, the current systems of social protection and risk management in Brazil
have not been sufficient to fully mitigate the wave of uncertainty brought by the
COVID-19 pandemic. It has materialized into a tsunami of losses, especially for the
most vulnerable, making our quest toward equality of opportunity even more difficult; the road towards emancipation and freedom has been significantly extended for
Brazilian citizens.

2.7 Planting Seeds of Hope in Shaken Terrain: The
Possibilities to Build a Future After a Traumatic Event
As the previous section suggested, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated and
will continue to exacerbate historical inequalities which have constituted the making
of democratic Brazil. From barriers to access to learning losses, the nation has struggled to ensure that education constitutes a human right rather than a luxury good in
the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the new coronavirus has tested
the ability of institutions to face adversity and mitigate risks. This ability to confront
crises has a direct impact on ordinary citizens’ ratings and perceptions of institutions’ readiness, malleability, and efficiency. Certainly, the extent to which this
pandemic has diminished or increased trust on current governance structures requires
further empirical consideration. Nevertheless, not all institutions seem to be able to
strengthen risk-management tenets, and we observe important social developments
that can be linked to citizens’ evaluation of institutional performance. For example,
the new Ministry of Education decided to carry out the Brazilian National High
School Evaluation (ENEM) in January 2021. ENEM is an extremely important exam,
and it represents a rite of passage in Brazil because it serves as a classificatory tool for
college entrance nationwide. Originally scheduled for November 2020, the exam was
postponed for a few months as a mitigation strategy, which also gave students more
time to prepare in the novel COVID-19 context. However, over 50 percent of students
who had registered to participate in both in person and online formats did not show
up to examination sites in January 2021. Absenteeism was extremely high compared
to previous years, in both modes of delivery. Several reasons could have caused this
phenomenon, including social fears of getting infected by the new coronavirus and
general negative social perceptions of institutional capacity to administer this examination in a time of crisis. In a nutshell, COVID-19 tested the ability of institutions
to collectively mitigate risks to deliver public goods, affecting social perceptions of
institutional performance with implications for social welfare and democracy.
By the same token, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the roles of diverse
institutions in strengthening risk management. There exists a longstanding debate in
Brazil about whether other sectors, other than the public, should play a role in the
field of education. This debate must certainly be ongoing in a democracy, and we
believe COVID-19 provided an opportunity for people to re-evaluate how diverse
sectors can come together to strengthen the response to unforeseeable crises and
deliver educational opportunity for all, especially when longstanding institutions
face internal dilemmas and crisis of their own. Indeed, rather than substituting or
replacing development forces, COVID-19 underscored the importance of relying on
several sources to strengthen risk management to mitigate shocks in complementary
ways. This global health crisis has created an opportunity to keep this conversation
alive, and it has the power to raise awareness and foster novel insights about the
complementary ways in which development actors can come together to prevent
losses and foster development as freedom.

2 Experiences with Risk-Management and Remote Learning …

55

Besides this opportunity to rethink development, the country has also accumulated
several lessons that may inform our recovery agenda in the days to come. For example,
in the State of Goiás, the social innovation start-up Movva (https://movva.tech/en/
about/) incentivized high school students to stay “engaged in distance learning activities (online and offline) and enrolled in school when face-to-face classes resume”
(Lichand & Christen, 2020, p. 2). This start-up powered an intervention by sending
text messages to over 12,000 high school students over the course of four weeks
(Lichand & Christen, 2020, p. 2). The messages contained encouraging statements
such as “It is normal to be afraid in times of uncertainty. Use this scenario to your
advantage: take the opportunity to develop the ability to focus on your plans for the
future” (Lichand & Christen, 2020, p. 11). Undertaking a Randomized Control Trial
(RCT) and monitoring student dropouts and their self-reported levels of motivation,
researchers were able to claim that this strategy worked to nudge students during the
pandemic. For example, only 13.5% of students in the treatment group maintained
that they would not go back to school when classes resumed, compared to 24% in
the control group (Lichand & Christen, 2020, p. 3).
In addition to interventions to prevent school dropouts, Brazil has also advanced its
agenda to close the “digital divide,” a historic and distinct feature of our educational
landscape (Rosa & Azenha, 2015). Although civil society and other segments felt that
the mitigation response from the Ministry of Education was inadequate, the National
Congress of Brazil demonstrated a will to support an agenda of development focused
on equity. Several congresspeople drafted and approved the bill PL 3477/2020, which
has recently been forwarded to the Senate, to ensure that public students and teachers
have access to the internet during these unprecedented times (National Congress
of Brazil, 2020). Another important and recent development spearheaded by the
legislative branch in Brazil, the ratification of the law nº 13.985/2019, may aid our
recovery efforts too. This law guarantees the placement of psychologists in Brazilian
public schools to support students and educators throughout their entire education.
The inclusion of psychologists in schools may help educational institutions in the
country become “trauma-informed schools” (Lawson et al., 2019) by supporting
learning, facilitating the recognition of shared and individual trauma, and prioritizing
the promotion of community healing. This certainly constitutes a key mitigation and
recovery strategy, and one which may be highly valued by all segments of society as
students and educators return to schools and begin to experience the long-term effects
of COVID-19 related traumas. This is also an area that merits research consideration:
different populations of students across the various dimensions of diversity might
have experienced and accumulated different kinds of traumas throughout the course
of the pandemic, such as racial trauma and traumas related to household violence.
Designing and evaluating interventions to transform schools into communities of
healing, trauma-informed institutions in a post-pandemic world may be of paramount
importance for scholars and practitioners who aim to challenge systems of oppression
such as racism, sexism, and ableism in our schools to build socially just societies and
democracies.
Regarding Indigenous knowledge, the loss caused by COVID-19 cannot be underestimated. For Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers who work for and with

56

Indigenous communities, this time also constitutes a delicate moment. In the field
of Indigenous research, it would be important to understand how COVID-19 could
reinforce historical patterns of disempowerment, potentially undermining reconciliatory efforts between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations and the state—
especially in Brazil, which has hampered sustainable development and positioned
Indigenous communities in precarious conflicts of dispossession over the past few
years (Santos et al., 2020). Understanding how Indigenous communities perceive
these losses, whether and how educational systems will portray these losses to the
public over the years, and how this might affect the forging of respectful relationships
in democratic Brazil constitute an area of attention for Indigenous research in the
field of education.
Similarly, concerning the construction of a new curriculum-as-plan—the bundles
of knowledge, skills, and dispositions that students ought to develop and learn through
schooling—the pandemic poses opportunities and challenges. As discussed in the
main body of this text, curriculum re-prioritization became the terminology that
helped Brazilian educational leaders translate learning rights into COVID-19 contextual learning priorities. The development of knowledge and skills is key to expanding
freedoms, and so are the timely, complicated conversations that students engage in
collectively and independently. Both in and outside of classrooms, student discourse
about issues that directly affect their livelihoods, subjective identities, and wellbeing
is critical (Pinar, 2019). With constrained learning schedules and additional measures
to recover learning losses in a post-pandemic world, understanding how educational
leaders, teachers, and other stakeholders negotiate curriculum-as-plan to promote
holistic education, and how this negotiation might affect students’ educational experiences, the “curriculum-as-lived” (Aoki et al., 2012), constitutes a site for exploration
and interrogation. Indeed, the relevance of schooling and its curriculum-as-plan might
be intrinsically linked to these decisions and conversations.
Finally, we comment on the question of learning losses itself. To address losses in
knowledge and skills in formal schools, remedial programs will likely merit policy
attention during the remaining period of the pandemic and beyond. Because the
ramifications of COVID-19 have affected all segments of education and created tight
budget constraints, a call for scalability will potentially become a feature of such
programs. In this scenario, hybrid modes of instruction may become an attractive
option for policymakers, notably in lower and upper secondary levels when more
mature students could benefit from these interventions. These programs may aid the
offering of regular classes once face-to-face classes resume, especially in cases where
educational systems provide services through double-shift schools. These programs
may allow students to continue acquiring knowledge and honing skills once children
finish regular school hours. Additionally, it may circumvent problems related to
space constraints since students may not need to stay in classrooms to participate
in hybrid programs. It is pivotal that students who have been historically positioned
at-risk benefit from social policies that aim to reduce the opportunity cost from
participating in such interventions. Cooperation and coordination between education
and social assistance sectors can never be underestimated. For scholars, designing
and evaluating the effectiveness of these remedial programs will also constitute an

important course of action, for we are now striving to better understand how to
institutionalize parameters to mitigate future disruptions and strengthen our risk
management systems in a volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous world. Despite
a shaken terrain, seeds of hope are being planted, but germination is also contingent
upon the kinds of coalitions and knowledge that we foster and gather to nurture the
roots of development as freedom in Brazil and beyond.

Abstract This chapter examines how Chilean education was affected by the
COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Like all school systems worldwide, Chilean education was strongly impacted, with schools closing for nearly the entire academic year,
which necessitated an improvised “distance education.” This new system faced enormous difficulties, especially in rural sectors and for families that lacked sufficient
resources in their homes, which in the case of Chile represent a significant portion of
the population. Based on secondary sources and a study conducted by the authors,
this chapter begins by describing the fundamental characteristics of Chilean education before continuing with an overview of the principal actions undertaken by public
authorities to confront the pandemic in the educational sphere; we then present the
(scant) information available on how the suspension of in-person classes affected
different school actors and summarize the basic findings of our own study on this
topic, whose focus is educational experiences at home. The chapter concludes with
some reflections of a more general nature that seek to situate the educational debate
triggered by the pandemic in a broader context, concerning the future evolution of
the education system.

3.1 Education in Chile: Basic Context
The Chilean school system is known worldwide as an extreme case of the educational
market, in which education is strongly decentralized, highly privatized1 , markedly
segregated, and in which a subsidiary state assumes a regulatory and evaluative role
(Bellei 2015; Parcerisa & Falabella 2017; Valenzuela et al. 2014). In administrative
terms, in Chile there are two school types: public, which depend on municipalities

1 Chile is among the countries with greatest private participation in school education (OECD 2014).

and Local Education Services2 —intermediary bodies autonomous from the Ministry
of Education—and private, which are entirely autonomous. Within the latter sector,
there are private schools without state funding (which charge families high tuition
fees) and subsidized private schools which, like public schools, are funded via a perstudent subsidy (given that families have the freedom to choose a school, schools
compete for family preferences to obtain more resources). In addition to receiving
state resources, a minor part of subsidized private schools charge a copayment to
parents3 , and until 2015 they could profit from their earnings.
Within this arrangement, school enrollment is concentrated mainly in subsidized
schools (92%), mostly private (56%), while public schools account for only 36% of
students. One of the most salient consequences of the Chilean educational market
model is the soaring socioeconomic segmentation and segregation between schools,
along with the marked stigmatization and marginalization of public education (Bellei
et al. 2018), which is attended primarily by students from the poorest homes. On the
other extreme, unsubsidized private schools educate the highest-income students and
have historically represented a smaller percentage of the enrollment—currently 8%.
In Chile there are 12 years of compulsory schooling (as of 2003), beginning
with the first level of primary education, which lasts 8 years. Secondary education
is divided into a common cycle (9th and 10th grades) and a differentiated cycle
(11th and 12th grades), with tracks for scientific, humanistic, technical/vocational,
and artistic education. Coverage is nearly universal in the case of primary education
(99.7%) and very high in secondary education (87.7%) (MINEDUC 2018). In 2020,
school enrollment climbed to 3,608,158 students. Although preschool education is
not compulsory, coverage for kindergarten is very high (currently 94% according to
Ministry of Education data from 2019).
Among the functions of the Ministry of Education are the formulation of the
national curriculum, which is mandatory for all schools, and the determination of
learning standards for each level. All schools, both public and private, have freedom of
teaching; that is, they can offer their own curriculum if it covers the learning objectives
established by the ministry. However, in practice schools do not differ significantly
in terms of curricula and tend to follow ministerial plans and programs. In addition, the Ministry evaluates both schools and teachers through strong accountability
mechanisms. For this, it relies on an institutional framework (Agency of Quality, and
the Superintendence of Education) in charge of school supervision, evaluation, and
orientation, and it intensively utilizes standardized tests of academic achievement
(SIMCE) to apply sanctions and support. Initially created to inform parents in the
process of school choice and foster competition between schools, SIMCE results are
widely publicized in the school system and the press.

As will be seen, the heightened decentralization and decoupling of the Chilean
system, its marked socioeconomic stratification, and its strong focus on curricular
coverage and external learning evaluation affected its capacity to adequately respond
to the complex scenario generated by the pandemic.

3.2 Policies Adopted to Confront the Pandemic
in Education
The first case of COVID-19 detected in Chile, in early March 2020, coincided with
the beginning of the school year. After two weeks, the closing of all schools and
preschool establishments, both public and private, was ordered, and the majority
would not return to in-person activities at all during the year.
Following the suspension of classes, government education policy was redirected
primarily toward facilitating conditions for schools, teachers, and students to be
able to continue the school year through distance learning. This has meant multiple
challenges that are not limited to deficits in technological equipment and connectivity,
though to be sure this aspect has been a major limitation for a substantial proportion
of students and schools, and part of the government’s efforts have been directed
toward filling such gaps. Although, as we will see later, the lack of access to devices
and a stable internet connection is a problem that continues to affect a significant
proportion of students, despite the different initiatives promoted by the government
and other private and public organizations (such as universities). This line of policies
and actions4 can be grouped as follows:
(a)

Online pedagogical support for teachers, students, and families: Various types
of support for distance learning have been created and made available to all
school communities. These include the webpage “I Learn Online,” (Curriculum
Nacional, 2020) which brings together pedagogical material, textbooks, videos,
and exercises for all grades, and is adapted for use by students, teachers, and
parents; through an alliance with the Mobile Telephone Association of Chile,
downloads of school textbooks and guides are free of charge. In addition, software and applications to promote reading and ludic educational activities have
been distributed; the Digital School Library has been enhanced, and reading
clubs have been created as part of the literacy plan; free university preparation classes have been made available (so students finishing secondary school
can prepare for the national higher education admissions test); a television
channel has been created—TV Educa—in partnership with other public and
private bodies, transmitting exclusively entertaining educational and cultural
content from the first through fourth grade curriculum (MINEDUC 2020a);
and lastly—although nearly at the end of the school year—an educational
radio station was created for students in remote areas.

Support for schools and teachers: The availability of free software such as
Gsuite and Office 365 A1 enabled for 5,700 schools; courses, training, and
conferences on the use of educational platforms, the use of ICT tools, curricular prioritization, and socioemotional learning; and infrastructure plans for
improvement, replacement, fitting out, and adaptation of school spaces for the
return to classes. The topic of school coexistence and socioemotional assistance has also represented an area of reflection and guidance for schools. The
Ministry generated guides for families and their socioemotional wellbeing and
material for teachers to face the overload of work (MINEDUC 2020b, c, d).
In April 2020, the authorities also relaxed the Preferential School Subsidy
Law5 , allowing schools to use subsidies for technological resources, sanitation, cleaning and disinfection of infrastructure, resources for infrastructure
modification, and other activities to confront COVID-19 (Superintendencia
de la Educación 2020). Furthermore, from May to November, the Agency of
Educational Quality changed its strategy of support and evaluation to an online
modality in which 846 schools from around the nation participated in “mentorships,” “remote visits,” (with an instrument simpler than the face-to-face),
and “Agency Connects” (a virtual space where schools with noteworthy practices can share their good experiences), among which the mentorships were
the best attended. The same agency, in August 2020, also created a “Citizen
Consultation” to respond to the question, what is educational quality in the
context of the pandemic? (With a view to rethink online support), in which
more than 37,226 people participated (71% of them parents or guardians).
The main results were that students’ socioemotional contexts were crucial to
learning; that it was important to continue with online learning and strengthen it
through more tools and resources; and that participation and interaction among
students was essential.
Support focused on students: Mainly directed at low-resource students,
subsidized schools, technical/vocational schools, and rural/isolated areas.
Computers and tablets have been provided along with broadband mobile
phones and physical educational materials; the school feeding program has
been maintained (through the delivery of food boxes to families); and discounts
for public transportation have been arranged. Meanwhile, for students with
difficulty accessing the internet, the “I Learn at Home” plan was launched,
delivering educational materials similar to the “I Learn Online” program in
printed form, along with reinforcement booklets (UNESCO 2020).

5 The Preferential Subsidy created in 2008 provides additional resources to schools with students

from low socioeconomic backgrounds; these resources can only be spent on items stipulated in an
annual school improvement plan that each school designs.

3 The Fragility of the School-in-Pandemic …

83

Additionally, considering that the possibilities of addressing the compulsory
national curriculum appeared to be seriously restricted by the reduction of class time,
in May the government proposed a Curricular Prioritization that defined essential
learning objectives for each grade and subject, which entailed making plans of study
and mechanisms of evaluation more flexible for each school. The proposed curricular
prioritization is based on the achievement of learning objectives at distinct levels,
prioritizing the first level and incentivizing comprehensive approaches that integrate
distinct objectives and even subjects. In terms of content, the proposal establishes
that the plan of studies should be focused on the subjects of Language and Communication and Mathematics, although the subjects of Counseling and Technology are
also important and represent a space that must be maintained. In terms of educational levels, certain critical courses are being focused on, including first and second
grade (literacy); eighth and ninth grade (related to the transition to secondary education); and twelfth grade (focused on the completion of secondary school). Lastly, it
has been emphasized that each school should decide what is fundamental in their
study plans and how this can be adapted to the curricular prioritization (MINEDUC
2020f). The curricular prioritization is optional, as each school can adjust it according
to their context and conditions, and it will be valid for all of 2020 and 2021, with the
expectation of resuming the official national curriculum in March 2022.
Despite all of these supports and flexibilization measures, the government’s
strategy to face the pandemic at the school level was problematic, which points
to poor political management and limited capacity for dialogue and empathy with
the school communities and families living through a crisis scenario.
The first issue was the failure to concretize a return to face-to-face activities during
2020. The first estimated return date was set at the end of April, after declaring an early
“winter break,” when the pandemic was still in its initial stages and the scenario was
highly uncertain. The decision was widely criticized by various sectors, including
health and education experts, and especially the teachers’ union. Later, with the
second half of the school year well advanced, the Ministry convened a work group,
together with UNESCO, that created a proposal that included evidence on the negative
effects of a prolonged interruption of classes, knowledge of international experiences
of reopening, and a participatory dialogue on reopening classes and the nature of
monitoring and accompaniment in schools that reopen (MINEDUC 2020e). Thus, it
was only as recently as October, after the creation of this committee of experts, that
a protocol was designed for the “secure return” and some schools began to partially
restart in-person activities. However, the scant credibility of or confidence in the
authorities, the limited previous investment to refurbish schools (during most of the
year the government rejected providing additional resources for this purpose), and
the pressing fears of families who had primarily opposed the return impinged upon
the reopening process, which ultimately was only carried out by a small fraction of
schools, and mainly in high-income sectors. Furthermore, the disagreements between
the Ministry and the teachers’ union, along with actors from civil society and local
authorities, did not cease and characterized the start of the 2021 school year.

84

C. Bellei et al.

The second issue was the government’s insistence on maintaining standardized
assessments of school actors in the middle of a social and health crisis. This was
clearly expressed by the government’s determination on maintaining the SIMCE test
(System for Measuring the Quality of Education), although it was later transformed
into an optional measure to be used for informational purposes based on a sample
of schools, the Ministry initially upheld its normal application, a situation that was
widely questioned by the teachers’ union, experts in the area, and various educational
institutions6 . Another case was the National Teacher Evaluation, which was also
maintained, although as a voluntary activity7 . The main criticisms against these
measures point to the validity of the results in a context of exceptional crisis, and
thus to their limited utility for decision-making; to the stress that such measures
entail for educational communities, given that the SIMCE, along with the National
Teacher Evaluation, are tools utilized for classification of schools and teachers and
the allocation of economic resources and incentives; and to the unjustified use of
these resources that could be redirected to other priority areas in education. A final
example was the maintenance of the practice of grade repetition based on student
performance, which, being a questionable pedagogical measure with known negative
effects even in normal times, was hardly justifiable amidst a crisis in which most
students have barely been able to maintain their engagement with the educational
process from home.
Finally, there is little information available on how local public education administrators have confronted the pandemic, although some innovative practices have
been documented. For example, in terms of semi-rural areas, the Lampa Municipality published a manual specifically aimed at supporting families in terms of
recreation, promoting physical activity to improve the time at home (Corporación
Municipal Lampa 2020); and the María Pinto Municipality managed to continue the
functioning of their youth orchestras online, prioritizing extracurricular and artistic
contents (Corporación Municipal de María Pinto 2020). In urban areas, the Renca
Municipality encouraged the development of a project-based learning methodology
for its schools and published a catalogue of good practices among its schools (Equipos
Educativos de la Corporación Municipal de Renca 2020); and in the Las Condes
Municipality, a website called “Learn While Traveling” was created, which was
focused on pre-school education and displayed different “worlds” (aspects of knowledge) with material prepared by local educators, including about the human body,
animals, the universe, and culture, among others. These examples demonstrate innovation and concern for enriching students’ experiences during the pandemic that
exceed curricular prioritization.

3.3 Effects of the Pandemic on the Educational Process
and the Responses of Actors8
The relocation of school to the home has forced the reinvention of various educational actors amidst an unprecedented situation in which the most basic aspects of
teaching processes have become a challenge: creating educational strategies that
overcome inequalities, allowing all students to have an educational experience with
even minimum safeguarding of learning, and socioemotional conditions and wellbeing at home. In this section we present the main challenges and opportunities that
were faced during 2020 by schools, teachers, principals, families, and students in
this distance-learning scenario through a review of Chilean empirical literature that
tackled these subjects.
The school is a space of socialization that allows community and support networks
to be formed between distinct educational actors, so its functioning based on communication is key to coordinating a system that structurally organizes a significant
portion of families’ and students’ lives. During the pandemic, the closing of the school
and its relocation to the home has transformed daily lives and private and shared
spaces, leading to the question of how to improve and deepen the emerging relationships among actors. Likewise, the educational experiences of children confined
to their homes have uncovered deep inequality and social, material, and territorial
exclusion, revealing the fragility of the diverse actors who sustain the “educational
chain.” Specifically, we refer to the following: a school with an essential social role
that must maintain minimum teaching conditions; the teachers working to stay in
contact with students and providing learning tools and socioeconomic resources,
which are especially important during a crisis of this proportion; the families and
students who must balance their private spheres with experiences of working and
studying at home; and finally, the role of the state in implementing public policy
in a realistic manner that can effectively answer the needs of a profoundly altered
education system.
A study on educators at the national level demonstrated that teachers have developed a new ethos in their work during this period, since the focus of their pedagogical labor has not been placed solely on learning achievements-as it was prior to
the pandemic-but also on concern for the social and emotional situation of families
(CIAE, Eduinclusiva, Eduglobal 2020). Some have had to support families in terms
of food and household wellbeing, becoming involved in the precarious situations of
students in rural areas who do not have access to connectivity or material learning
resources. In low-income urban sectors, the reality is not much different, as explained
by the director of a school in a working-class area of Santiago: “they live in houses
that are 425, 475 square feet (40–45 mt2), with five or six people, without the real
possibility of having a place to study. These are families with the parents out of
work, who today are more worried about figuring out meals, where the focus is put

on surviving, and their kids’ education takes second place” (Equipos Educativos de
la Corporación Municipal de Renca 2020, p.17).
School and home are mutually necessary because the proper functioning of one
is a condition for the stability and progress of the other. However, many teachers
perceive a relative absence of parents. One study on teacher wellbeing, also national
in scope, revealed that only 25% affirm that their students have an adult available
to help them with school during the health crisis (Fundación Chile 2020). Likewise,
teachers perceive a lack of interest among families and students when receiving new
content, while 40% of teachers feel less supported than before the pandemic by
parents and guardians (Elige Educar 2020). The comparative mental health research
by (Lagarribel, Halpern, Montt & Rojas-Andrade 2021) also showed more than 50%
of teachers present high stress symptoms and significant mood disturbances. What
has caused the most stress were the psychological demands of a year of the pandemic:
many had to urgently learn digital skills that they did not have. They had to quickly
transform their way of doing face-to-face classes to online platforms, which was
worsened by a context in which, before the pandemic, 78% of teachers were only
at an initial level of digital skills. (Claro, Salinas, Cabello-Hutt, San Martín, Preiss,
Valenzuela & Jara 2018).
Connectivity problems while maintaining an online distance school have reinforced existing inequity9 . The participation of students in daily school activities
has varied considerably based on school type: public school teachers estimate that
only 14% of their students participate in virtual classes versus 81% in unsubsidized
private schools (CIAE, Eduinclusiva, Eduglobal 2020); in addition, 71% of teachers
claim that their students have had connection problems when receiving pedagogical
information and resources (Elige Educar 2020); lastly, only one out of four Chilean
teachers believes that their students possess the resources and tools necessary to
participate in distance education (Fundación Chile 2020). According to a longitudinal study with a sample of 16,000 homes throughout the country, 1.2% of students
did not receive any online class or educational materials during the pandemic10 , while
students with weaker internet connections could only receive brief daily educational
capsules via social networks like WhatsApp or by email, and a very small proportion
could connect with their teacher directly for a class. In fact, 38% of public-school
teachers confirmed that they communicate with their students through telephone calls
when the connection is deficient, a means that is virtually unused in private schools
(CIAE, Eduinclusiva, Eduglobal 2020). By contrast, 85% of students from unsubsidized private schools have received online classes with the possibility of interacting
with the teacher and their classmates (which points to frequent use of platforms like
9 At the national level, reports indicate that 12.6% of Chilean homes did not have an internet

connection in 2017. In homes with school-age children or youth (defined as 5 to 24 years old), this
statistic drops to 6%, though it is 10% in the lowest-income quintile of the population and 3% in
the highest-income quintile (Subsecretaría de Telecomunicaciones 2017).

Google Classroom, Zoom, or Aula Virtual), compared to 33% of their peers in public
schools (Elige Educar 2020).
One of the great gaps in this period of learning at home has been the lack of
interaction among students. According to a citizen survey carried about by the Agency
of Educational Quality, 55% of parents and guardians state that their children have
not interacted with classmates during 2020 (Agencia de Calidad de la Educación
2020), although there are significant differences based on school type, with public
school students being the most isolated. In the case of rural areas, the students’
experience has been even more solitary. A teacher from Chépica (a rural zone in
central Chile) explained that she has “prepared individual guides and been working
with the rural modules that the Ministry of Education sends us. All that material has
been sent on printed paper to the students”11 (Enseña Chile 2020). In some cases, this
includes distribution to students’ homes by the teachers themselves, while in others,
families must go to the school. Meanwhile, in terms of the lack of connectivity and
interactive classes, 70% of teachers claim that a main teaching–learning activity is the
weekly delivery of work materials (“guides”) to their students (CIAE, Eduinclusiva,
Eduglobal 2020).
In general, to communicate with students, teachers have stated that they use
email (63%), WhatsApp (55%), Google Classroom or Zoom (34%), school textbooks (33%), telephone calls (30%), YouTube (26%), printed work guides (23%),
other textbooks (15%), Facebook or Instagram (14%), and SMS (7%) (Elige Educar
2020), which illustrates the diverse efforts that have been made. Beyond pedagogical encounters with students, 42% of teachers have contacted their students to find
out how they are doing during the pandemic through social networks, which have
enabled a new form of interaction (CIAE, Eduinclusiva, Eduglobal 2020).
These new forms of communication have opened the possibility of new methodologies, generating activities that can maintain students’ attention. For example, some
teachers report that they have motivated uninterested students through activities on
WhatsApp including audio stories, guessing games, rhymes, and tongue twisters,
or with relaxation and mindfulness exercises or others that help identify emotions
through games and storytelling (CIAE, Eduinclusiva, Eduglobal 2020).
School principals have also been focused on learning development (66.7%) and
student wellbeing (54.5%) during the pandemic, and they believe that the health
crisis will make families value the work that teachers do with their children far
more (Montecinos et al. 2020). Principals believe that appreciating the importance
of students’ socioemotional wellbeing will help prepare them for other potential
crises, and they consider this period to have fostered students’ learning autonomy, in
addition to a revaluation of in-person classes for the personal and social interaction
they provide with classmates and teachers (Montecinos et al. 2020). In terms of
students’ educational situation, most principals anticipate a significant deterioration
in learning achievements and an increase in structural inequality, and in terms of

C. Bellei et al.

policy, they suggest focusing on flexibility and decreasing results-related pressure
on schools (Montecinos et al. 2020).
Finally, during this period the role of the family has been paramount, taking on
special prominence in children’s learning processes and balancing time and work
in the mission to keep the home on track emotionally, socially, and in terms of
education. But families themselves are fragile in the face of the pandemic. A study
that interviewed parents and guardians of children six years old or younger revealed
a stark image of home reality: 69% of parents state that their family incomes have
decreased since the pandemic began, 47% worry about a lack of food and/or clothing
for their family, 15% have been affected by the death of a loved one, 21% have
had a relative who was hospitalized, and 25% take medication to regulate sleep
or mood (CEDEP 2020). Meanwhile, in terms of educational priorities for their
children during this period, according to a study from the Agency of Educational
Quality (2020), the most essential for parents and guardians is reinforcing academic
learning, followed by an emerging necessity for emotional development. Topics
such as learning to live in a community and coexisting with others have returned to
center stage for families during this time because the socioemotional effects for the
entire family unit have been deep and unprecedented. It is important to note that the
weakness of the Chilean school in the psychological and social dimension predates
the pandemic, as the work of diverse educational actors has been overly focused
on academic dimensions and a traditional conception of the discipline (Salas et al.
2020), rather than on a comprehensive view of the school as a space for socialization
and development of skills for the 21st century (Bellei & Morawietz 2016).
In the case of early childhood, parents report that their children are more worried
and irritable, that it is harder for them to get up in the morning, and that they are
more fearful than before. While nearly two-thirds of children are demanding more
support and company, more than half feel irritable and angry or cry and have temper
tantrums, and 40% have lost the motivation to learn and explore (CEDEP 2020).
According to the same study, parents are worried about excessive screen time, the lack
of nature and fresh air, low social interaction with peers, high emotional reactivity,
decreased movement, and health risks related to missing check-ups and vaccines.
According to a study that evaluated the mental health of students before and after the
pandemic, 21% of parents indicated that their children evolved from not presenting
any symptoms related to their mental health before the pandemic to having at least
one during quarantine. The most significant increases were “lack of desire, even to
do activities that they like,” by 30%; “Changes in appetite” and “trouble sleeping,”
“both by 26% percent;” and “being sad” at 25% (Lagarribel, Halpern, Montt &
Rojas-Andrade 2021). But it has not all been negative, as parents have also valued
this period because they have been able to play, converse, and spend quality time with
their children, in addition to becoming involved in their learning process (CEDEP
2020).

3.4 The Fragility of the Experience of Schooling at Home
After a full year of “live-in” school, what do we know about how children’s
educational experiences have been at home? In this section, we present findings
from the study “Children’s educational experiences at home during the COVID19 pandemic12 ,” carried out by the authors and centered on the receiving end of
the educational act: the student. Considering the unprecedented scenario, this study
operated with a broad definition of “educational experience,” in which in addition to
exploring distinct instances of learning (formal, informal structured, and every day),
an approach to constraints on educability was also included—that is, a recognition
of the material, social, and personal surroundings that contribute to or detract from
learning.
Data was obtained through a self-administered online survey directed at parents
and guardians of school-age children (4–17-year-olds) and in-depth interviews
carried out with children between 8 and 13 years of age in different regions of
the country. The data collection was carried out between September 1 and October
14, 2020. The online questionnaire was partially based on the survey developed by
the Autonomous University of Barcelona “Confinement and Learning Conditions”
(Bonal & González 2020), adapted to Chilean reality.
A non-probabilistic sampling by quotas with basic coverage in all regions was
used together with post-stratification weights based on enrolment numbers by Municipality and School property (public, private, or subsidized). A sample of 4,912 households with children of school age were reached, with cases in all 16 regions of the
country, and in 241 municipalities, out of a total of 345 with school enrolment. The
sample collected represents geographical areas where 87% of the national enrolment
is located.
Regarding qualitative sampling, it was composed by a grand total of 47 children,
19 of them living in Metropolitan Region, 14 of them in Ñuble Region and 14 in Los
Rios Region, both in urban and rural areas. Out of this total, 22 were girls and 25 boys.
13 of them attended private schools (10 of which located in the Metropolitan Region),
19 of them attended subsidized private school (12 of them free of cost), 14 attended
municipal schools, and 1 girl attended home schooling. Regarding payment methods,
26 children attended free schools, while 21 attended paid schools (even though not
all students who attended subsidized private schools with co-pay effectively paid for
tuition).

12 The study was funded by the National Research Agency through the “Concurso para la Asignación

Rápida de Recursos para Proyectos de Investigación sobre el Coronavirus (Covid-19) Año 2020”
along with base funds from the Centro de Investigación Avanzada en Educación at the Universidad
de Chile.

A “change of venue:” With the school in pandemic, inequality migrated to the
internet
The impact of adapting the school to a virtual modality varied in intensity according to
pre-existing conditions. The school in pandemic is incapable of attenuating inequalities of origin, given the difficulty of standardization from a distance. This occurs
despite the virtual school presenting a fairly common base modality, among whose
attributes are the scheduling of online classes on virtual platforms and the implementation of learning resources, with guides and videos prepared by teachers being
the most usual.
This modality, however, presents significant differences based on school type
according to our study, while 8 of 10 students from unsubsidized private schools
receive online classes every day, in public schools and free subsidized private schools,
the amount varies enormously: on one extreme, only 3 of 10 students claim to have
class every day; on the other, 2 of every 10 students state that they “never have classes
online.” These differences are in turn augmented by unequal criteria that operate
when online classes are carried out. We observed through our qualitative data that
unsubsidized private schools have divided their courses to ensure more personalized
learning, while subsidized private schools have opted for joining courses, which
can reach more than 50 students online in unison. Likewise, public schools and free
subsidized private schools have depended on more traditional support, such as guides
and physical materials sent home and communication via telephone or email, all less
efficient means.
In terms of content, it is evident that the school in pandemic is greatly hindered
in terms of fostering comprehensive learning. Through interviews with students,
we noticed that curricular prioritization has been one measure adopted by a significant proportion of schools, configuring a standard foundation of mathematics and
language, and another that is a bit more sophisticated, which includes social and
natural sciences. According to the children interviewed, the arts and physical education have generally been the most neglected subjects, being retained primarily for
students from unsubsidized private schools.
It is also important to highlight the transformation of evaluative parameters in the
face of a limited school environment. Though schools have incorporated criteria of
curricular hierarchization, a “survival strategy” is applied on the part of the students.
Thus, students with less motivation toward school only complete the guides that will
be evaluated or are up to date solely in the subjects that “count to pass the grade.” This
measure has resulted in the formation of an insurmountable gap in the framework of
the school in pandemic. As we observed in the survey, 25% of students devoted less
than 1 hour per day to school activities and 33% dedicated 4 hours or more, which
leads to a monthly difference of at least 60 hours between the two, differences that
are strongly associated with their family socioeconomic status. It is important to note
differences in dedication to schooling between the different educational levels. While
almost half of those students in primary school (48%) and a third of those among
secondary school students (34%) dedicated two hours or less to curricular activities,
most students attending pre-primary school only dedicated one hour or less. On the

3 The Fragility of the School-in-Pandemic …

91

other end of the spectrum, those who dedicated the most time to curricular activities
were secondary students, with 38% of them dedicating 5 hours or more of time to
curricular activities.
Thus, it is necessary to be emphatic: the school in pandemic has exacerbated the
structural inequalities of the Chilean education system. In this modality, the shortage
of resources is intensified, as the existing differences have been translated to a single
virtual space which, in disadvantaged sectors, multiplies the flaws of the school with
the shortcomings of the home.
What is left “unseen” by distance learning
This year, a large majority of virtual classes were carried out with “camera off”
students. Whether due to the weakness of their connection, the deficiency of their
equipment, or individual discomforts, children were in class only as listeners, without
necessarily giving any sign of attention or presence. This metaphor leads to a discussion of the “blind spots” of the school in pandemic, which play a significant role in
the evaluation of the past year.
To this effect, we can observe how unequal material opportunities for study
interact. Thus, in homes of more than 1,075 square feet (100 mt2), more than 80% of
children always have a space of their own to study and do homework, far exceeding
the possibilities of those who live in houses of 320 square feet (30 mt2), of whom
only 36% have a space to study that is always available and 34% have no such space.
Convergently, this gap is repeated for other constraints of educability, including
possessing didactic resources, a good internet signal, or a desk.
In the same vein, a spatial overlap of the school and the home occurs. Thus,
those who live in more spacious homes or who have exterior spaces in which to
“disconnect” from the school environment are in a better emotional state in terms of
educability, compared to those who cannot physically separate from their at-home
school workspace.
Another resource for educability, highlighted by results of the questionnaire, was
access to a computer used exclusively for schoolwork and internet connections. While
2 of 3 students from unsubsidized private schools have their own computer, only 1 of
3 of their peers from free subsidized private schools possess this resource, while 1 in
8 do not even have a computer. Meanwhile, in the homes of students from subsidized
private schools, only 1 of 5 can rely upon mobile internet connections and this figure is
doubled in the case of students from free subsidized private schools. When evaluating
connection quality, while nearly a third (29%) of students who attend free subsidized
private schools or public schools have connections that they consider deficient, this
indicator is halved (14%) among those who attend unsubsidized private schools.
While material provisions are fundamental to face the situation of the school in
pandemic, it would be impossible to do so without a family to carry the demands
of the “live-in” school. In this context, another critical gap that appeared on the
survey and during the interviews was the clear dependency on the mother for the
achievement of the educational process, with the mediation of the school in the
home environment resting on her shoulders. This situation leads to repercussions
in family coexistence, in which half of people claim to completely agree or agree

92

C. Bellei et al.

with the statement that girls and women have been more exposed to some form of
violence (physical, psychological, or sexual) in the home, while 71% affirm that
mainly women have been in charge of domestic work and care. Thus, for 92%
of preschool students and 81% of primary school students, it is the mother who
oversees “activating” the school at home, helping with schoolwork, and providing
some measure of supervision to ensure their children’s continuity in this situation.
In this way, the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the multiple factors that affect
learning. To secure optimal educational processes (both formal and informal), it is
not enough to guarantee a larger material equity. On top of this, pressure inside the
household, domestic violence, and an overload of work for mothers are also factors
which affect the education of children.
The reinvention of the child’s world: Between emotional inequality and alternative
ways of learning
The school in pandemic has been fundamentally challenging for children. Added to
the situation already described, many girls and boys have had to grapple with loneliness during lockdown. In interviews, a substantial proportion affirmed that friends,
recreation, and the ordinary life they share are some of the experiences they miss
the most, being above all moments in which they do not have to fill the role of
student or son or daughter. Undoubtedly, social distancing, lockdowns, the suspension of classes, and the general economic crisis have impacted the wellbeing and
emotional world of these generations. The results of our survey show that socioemotional problems affect a significant proportion of students, with the most prevalent
being getting bored easily (52%), difficulty concentrating (46%), not wanting to do
schoolwork (43%), and getting frustrated often (40%). Additionally, between onequarter and one-third of children have been more conflictive and more irritable, as
well as experienced alterations in sleep and appetite. It is worth mentioning that
socio-emotional measurements showed variations according to educational level,
being secondary age students (between 14 and 18 years old) those most affected by
lockdown. Meanwhile, primary school students had trouble complying with homework and curricular activities. Preschool students (4 to 5 years old) struggled mostly
with everyday stress related situations. These effects vary by case: in the context of
better social and economic conditions, there tends to be greater capacity to regulate
the demands (physical, psychological, and material) of this situation. To confront the
stress and loneliness of this period, many children have taken refuge in technological
devices amidst the entropy of daily life. According to the survey, 86% of children are
in front of a screen every day (television, tablet, or cellphone). Other daily activities
outside of school include helping with household work (40%), chatting with friends,
communicating via social networks (33%), and reading and playing video games
(32%).
It becomes clear, then, why the management of free time has been one of the
most complex spheres to resolve during the lockdown. Going from 8 hours per day
at school to educational activities that often do not exceed a few 45 minutes blocks
per week is certainly complicated. In some cases, this situation has led children to

3 The Fragility of the School-in-Pandemic …

93

take a more proactive stance toward their emotional state, generally associated with
an exploration of their interior worlds.
Interestingly, 56% of families surveyed state that their child has developed new
interests and talents during this period of learning at home, in addition to autonomy
and self-confidence (61%). Indeed, 20% even consider their children to be learning
more at home than at school. If this last assertion is evaluated by educational levels,
67% of families with children in pre-school age agree with developing new interests
and talents during lockdown, while 54% of families of students in primary school
and 51% of secondary school students agree with this proposal. The massive use
of “do it yourself” tutorials, which not only reinforce a positive self-perception, but
also stimulate learning by doing as an approach of trial and error. Thus, when seeing
others of a similar age painting their rooms, transforming their clothing, cooking,
or organizing their things, children feel inspired, delve into their interests, and work
toward a finished product.
It should be noted that in this area, we identified certain gender differences. In
terms of the use of free time, we observed different manners of addressing the lack of
compulsory activities. Among girls, 77% engage in activities like drawing, painting,
or crafts every day or some days, compared to 58% of boys. Boys, meanwhile, play
videogames daily (72%), compared to 45% of girls. Likewise, a gap of 7 percentage
points was noted in terms of household contribution, with girls helping at home more
than boys, along with participating more on social media.
In this sense, while the experience of learning from home has been critical in all
cases and has confronted children with difficulties previously unknown to them, the
reinvention of the child’s world through play and the possibilities of informal learning
at home has become a way to accommodate the complexity of the process. In the face
of the destabilization of the school that provided continuity to their daily experience,
the evaporation of peers who were models of identity, and the absence of compulsory
time within the school institution, children have been able to practice autonomy,
creativity, and self-discipline, though in contexts of great material, emotional, and
family difficulties.

3.5 Final Reﬂections: Looking to the Post-pandemic School
Since at least the beginnings of the 20th century, the social sciences have repeatedly
returned to the discussion of the validity of the institution of the school, including
voices that suggest not only its decline but also the convenience of its replacement. More recently, some have joined the debate who believe that information and
communication technologies have become sufficiently sophisticated to dispense with
teachers to a large extent, joining a long tradition of faith in educational technology
that merges self-study guides, computers, and the internet. If we have re-learned
something from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is rather the opposite: the centrality of
the school in our society and the critical role teachers play as mediators of learning.

94

C. Bellei et al.

Of course, this does not imply that traditional schooling and teaching do not require
changes, a matter which we reflect on in this final section.
As the evidence discussed in this chapter has shown, as the school has become
secluded in the house, each has mimicked the other, and the educational process that
each child has experienced has depended decisively on conditions at home. In its
most basic sense, institutional education is a collective commitment to provide each
generation with a formative experience that is independent of the privileges or disadvantages of the family; it is a common formative experience that children have the
right to as citizens, beyond their families. What the pandemic has done is to remind
us of the urgency of this commitment. In a society such as Chile, plagued by inequalities and with significant proportions of children living in very basic conditions, the
closer to home the school comes, the less just it will be. Closing schools has a very
high, yet differential cost. This has a direct implication for the process of reopening
and returning to in-person class. Heterogeneity in terms of what learning has been
achieved in different circumstances will be the norm. Schools will need to organize
flexible pedagogical processes that are sensitive to this heterogeneity, recovering
for example the didactic strategies typical of multigrade classrooms, such as peer
tutoring.
As challenging as the work of “leveling learning” is, it is nevertheless a wellknown matter for Chilean schools, since—although at another scale—they dedicate themselves to it continuously. The truly complex task, by contrast, will be
understanding the centrality of the socioemotional experience of students, identifying traces of what they have lived through, and producing a favorable attitude
toward schoolwork beginning with their overall wellbeing. This refers to a longerterm undertaking, a more structural change that is required in education and that the
pandemic itself has helped us recognize as urgent. In Chile, curricular priorities are
strongly biased toward academic learning and pedagogy, very focused on instruction in fundamental cognitive abilities such as language and mathematics. Both the
intrapersonal and social dimensions of learning have traditionally been neglected
(Bellei & Morawietz 2016). Yet they are the two dimensions that have shown to be
most significant during the confinement and decoupling of daily life to which children have been subjected during this period. Higher order cognitive skills have also
been less emphasized, a competence that is needed to make sense of the complex
pandemic situation and undertake multidisciplinary learning.
The almost complete destabilization of children’s daily world has meant an enormous emotional load, with consequences for mental health and quality of life in
general that we are only just beginning to grasp, as we have shown throughout this
chapter. Schools and teachers have tried to provide support in this area, and—after
the initial shock—emphasis has increasingly been moving in this direction. Aspects
such as character building, finding meaning in things, finding purpose, and aligning
it with the will, self-maintenance or monitoring one’s own feelings, and more generally, staying healthy and dealing with insecurity and fears, are some examples of
“21st century skills” that the Chilean school has disregarded and that the school in
pandemic has had to dust off during a time of crisis. Furthermore, disciplines such
as the arts and sports (vital for staying healthy during this period), which constitute

3 The Fragility of the School-in-Pandemic …

95

excellent means of accessing these competencies, are frequently marginalized in the
Chilean school to privilege efforts toward standardized tests, which the authorities
use to create rankings and distribute awards and sanctions to schools and teachers
(Bellei et al. 2014, 2020). The post-pandemic school must recalibrate these priorities.
Social skills represent another domain that is even more undervalued by Chilean
education. There is little teaching of teamwork, collaborating in diverse contexts,
valuing differences, or arguing and being persuaded. The school in pandemic has
been even more solitary; in addition to the suspension of face-to-face classes, there
is the fact that teachers have made very little use of resources of dialogue and group
assignments with classmates. To give another example, during 2021, Chile will carry
out a process of creating a new political constitution because of the enormous social
mobilization of 2019; schools, especially secondary schools, will have an invaluable
opportunity to privilege citizen education and use the constitutional debates as catalysts for dialogue, inquiry, and participation with social and life processes of both
local and national contexts. Evidence shows that Chilean students are highly interested and motivated regarding public problems (indeed, they have also led massive
student movements for over a decade), but the school fails to take advantage of this
motivation, teaching them little or nothing about citizenship (Schulz et al. 2016).
Lastly, the school in pandemic has not only called curriculum and pedagogy into
question, but also the rules of its organization, the grammar of schooling (Tyack
& Tobin 1994), which includes detailed planning, rigid schedules, the courses, the
separation of subjects, and the rules of evaluation and repetition, just to name a
few. More fundamentally, the dissolution of the distinction between the space/time
of the home and the school and the roles of mother/teacher are the extreme manifestation of this abrupt and forceful deinstitutionalization. Indeed, many teachers
and families attempted to respond to the new scenario with known tools, those of
habitual modes of operation, including the extreme example of some schools which
required that their students wear a uniform at home to connect to Zoom classes, and
others that demanded that two cameras be turned on during evaluations to monitor
the behavior and surroundings of the student and avoid cheating. The educational
authorities, meanwhile, did the same, insisting on applying official standardized tests
of academic achievement. Upon returning to in-person classes, the temptation to go
back to “business as usual” will be great, and it will be necessary to resist it. Perhaps
it would be sometimes convenient to place students in smaller groups, and maybe the
criterion should not always be age, but rather their interests and motivations; perhaps
schedules should be flexible and variable to accommodate the state of mind of the
group in a given moment. And what would be the point of having students repeat
a grade in a context of a massive curricular delay, which in any case is probably
not the most important issue? The grammar of schooling must be revised using a
simple criterion: the rules that do not help rebuild individual and group health, that
do not help facilitate a process of healing and re-engagement with education, should
be put on hold. Increasing the instrumental productivity of the system will not be the
priority, and the selective and competitive logic that feeds into such objectives will
have been called into question not a moment too soon.

96

C. Bellei et al.

Before concluding, we offer a final comment looking beyond the field of education.
As we have argued, the centrality of the school to the functioning of society, family
dynamics, and children’s socialization has been reconfirmed by the dramatic “natural
experiment” that the pandemic has represented. Further, complementary functions
of the school, such as channeling social policy (e.g., nutrition), physical health (e.g.,
contagion prevention), and psychology (e.g., supporting students affected by the
stress and anguish of lockdown) can even be seen to have been reinforced during this
period. The centrality of classmates as a reference group and students’ daily social
coexistence has also been highlighted. The school is the main institution created to
embrace and promote the development of the society’s children and youth. However,
in Chile we have confirmed, at the same time, the fragility of the school, and more
generally of the education system as a whole. The absence of intermediate levels of
management that support the work of the schools at a local level, the virtual nonexistence of forms of horizontal cooperation and networking, and the lack of support
from local governments and other institutions to complement the work of schools has
also been highlighted, as well as the lack of political priority of children’s wellbeing
at the top of the agenda. We ask much of the school, and we support it little. In
the future, it will be necessary to rethink the monopolizing model of the school for
childhood, advancing toward the notion of “educating cities.” For example, this could
include creating new institutions in different communities that offer alternatives in
terms of education, exploration of interests, and sociability, and integrating the school
with the rest of the local and community organizations that exist. The school cannot
satisfy all the requirements of childhood, nor is it desirable that it would try.

Experiences of Moving Quickly
to Distance Teaching and Learning at All
Levels of Education in Finland
Jari Lavonen and Katariina Salmela-Aro

Abstract In this chapter, the teaching and learning in Finnish compulsory education during the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring and autumn terms of 2020 will
be analyzed and discussed. First, preconditions, such as teacher and student digicompetences and digi-infrastructure for switching to distance teaching and learning,
will be analyzed. Second, the organization and experiences of teaching and learning
during this time are described based on representative surveys conducted during and
after the spring 2020 distance teaching period. Finally, teachers’, principals’ and
students’ engagement and well-being during the pandemic will be analyzed based
on survey data. Preconditions for organizing effective distance teaching and learning
during the 2020 spring term were appropriate teacher and student digi-competences
and digi-infrastructure and availability of digi-tools. During the pandemic, teachers’
digi-pedagogy and students’ digi-competences developed. Moreover, several digipedagogy and co-teaching innovations were created. However, at the student level,
we identified decreased engagement during the pandemic, and at the teacher and principal levels, we identified not only decreased engagement but also increased stress
and even burnout. Principals suffered from teachers’ stress, whereas teachers suffered
from families’ inequality in coping with distance learning. All in all, the switch to
distance teaching and learning was organized effectively, but the distance-learning
period weakened the equality of teaching and the conditions for learning.

4.1 Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the education sector all over the world
and affected the learning of 1.6 billion children and young people in 200 countries (UNESCO, 2020). The pandemic has engaged researchers, administrators, and
teachers in the development of digital pedagogy or digi-pedagogical innovations.
Digi-pedagogy includes the knowledge and skills needed for using digital tools and

platforms or digital environments for teaching and learning, as well as the knowledge and skills needed to support students’ engagement, learning and well-being in
digital environments (Greenhow et al., 2020). Appropriate digi-pedagogy has helped
teachers with instructional design and the use of digital tools and platforms to support
students’ learning, engagement, and well-being.
Iivari et al. (2020) described an interesting case from spring 2020 in Finland,
where two fifth-grade teachers began to work as a team and shared their workload by
shifting online class responsibilities during the pandemic. The school days consisted
of two to four live lessons a day via Google Meet; half of the lessons were taught
by one teacher, half by the other. After a 20-min live teaching session, students had
40–50 min for individual work, after which the class gathered again on Google Meet
to discuss the outcomes. All of the day’s tasks were sent to students the previous
evening. At the end of the school day, the teachers checked pupils’ daily tasks in
Google Classroom and together planned the lessons for the next day. This type of
team-teaching was recognized as engaging for teachers and learners. The reason for
success with distance teaching in this case was that, first, both teachers and learners
were familiar with the Google Classroom format and had appropriate digital skills and
tools. Second, the teachers had quality training and were able to generate solutions to
new challenges. Third, the pupils had an internet connection at home, and the school
loaned laptops to pupils who did not have one at home. Although the pupils were
able to communicate and complete their assignments, the teachers were not able
to support the engagement and well-being of all learners. In addition, the students
lacked peer support and informal collaboration sessions.
The previous case provides a good example of the use of digi-pedagogy and
devices during the pandemic. However, the case does not reflect the full picture of
teaching and learning during the pandemic in Finland. In this chapter, teaching and
learning in Finnish compulsory school during the COVID-19 pandemic during the
spring and autumn terms of 2020 will be analyzed and discussed. First, preconditions,
such as teacher and student digi-competences and digi-infrastructure for distance
teaching and learning are described. Second, the organization and experiences of
teaching and learning during the pandemic are described based on representative
surveys conducted during this time. Finally, teacher, principal, and student wellbeing during the pandemic will be analyzed based on data collected during the
pandemic. We will argue in the discussion section that the development of digipedagogy strategies beginning in the 1980s, the implementation of these strategies,
and masters-level teacher education, which emphasizes the learning of competences
needed in professional learning, have made it possible for teachers to transition to
teaching online rather seamlessly.

4.2 Finnish Education Context
Decentralization and autonomy of municipalities, schools, and teachers characterize
the Finnish education context (Simola, 2005). Teachers play an important role in

4 Experiences of Moving Quickly to Distance Teaching and Learning …

107

the Finnish educational system. They are active participants in the design of local
curricula as well as physical and digital learning environments and courses and,
moreover, assess both their own teaching and students’ learning outcomes. This
decentralization has made it challenging to formulate state-wide decisions and to
provide uniform instructions during the pandemic. On the other hand, decentralization has offered flexibility in decision-making at the local level and has made it
possible to take into consideration the local context, such as the current situation of
the pandemic in each area or city. This decentralization, without testing and inspectors, could also be a threat to equality. However, politicians and families trust local
schools and teachers. This trust is a consequence of well-educated teachers and the
availability of general information on the education system. For example, according
to PISA assessments, the variation between schools has always been the smallest in
Finland among OECD countries (OECD, 2019b).
Educational equality and equity have been important education-related values and
aims in Finnish education since the 1970s, at all levels of education. There are no
private schools; instead, children and adolescents attend a nearby school. Finnish
special-needs education aims to integrate all learners into the same inclusive classrooms and to support their learning. Primary and secondary teachers are responsible
for monitoring the individual needs of learners and preparing a pedagogical document in the case of enhanced or intensified support, if needed. Decisions for the type
of support, such as a student’s integration into an ordinary class or part-time participation in a small group of students, are based on a pedagogical document, which is
prepared by a teacher for a student who has special needs (Finnish National Agency
for Education [FNAE], 2020a; Finnish National Board of Education [FNBE], 2014).
The development of support and special-needs education practices has decreased the
number of students who leave school early, from 11 to 7.5% between 2010 and 2019
(Statistics Explained, 2020). Because of decentralized decision-making and equality
as a value and aim, novel solutions could be created to support special-needs students
during the pandemic.
Teachers in Finland in primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary schools
are required to have a master’s degree. Primary teachers (grades 1–6) have been
educated in master’s-level programs at eight traditional universities for more than
40 years, while secondary teachers (Grades 7–12) have been prepared in master’slevel programs for more than 100 years (Niemi et al., 2012). An essential characteristic of teacher education in Finland has been its emphasis on research (Eklund, 2018;
Tirri, 2014). This orientation supports teachers in the local planning and assessment
processes and the organization of inclusive classrooms. The use of digital tools in preservice teacher education is integrated into the courses and teaching practice. This
could support student teachers in adopting the basics of digi-pedagogy. The development of the use of digital tools and environments in teacher education has been
organized through long-term strategic actions and through several research projects.
For example, during 2017–2018, at the University of Helsinki, e240,000 was used
for the development of digital learning environments and tools and for increasing
teacher educators’ digital competences.

4.3 Preconditions for Distance Teaching and Learning
During the Pandemic
There have been six official national-level digital education or Information and
Communication Technology (ICT) strategies and hundreds of development projects
during the last 35 years in Finland. Since 2015, these strategies have been integrated
or embedded in other strategies, such as government programs or curriculum documents (Mahlamäki-Kultanen et al., 2014). The national framework curriculum for
compulsory education emphasizes as a part of the description of transversal competences that students should be able to do the following: learn to use digital tools in
diverse and creative ways; collaborate and network with digital tools; and work with
data, information, and knowledge (FNBE, 2014; Ministry of Education and Culture
[MEC], 2017).
In addition to strategies and curriculum, resources have been available to aid the
implementation of strategic aims. For example, during the years 2016 – 2020, just
before the COVID period, the government allocated e100 million for educational
improvements. These funds were used for increasing teachers’ and students’ digital
competences. For example, 27 million euro was allocated for the development of
teachers pre-service education and for strengthening the connection between faculties of education and schools. About the same amount of money was allocated to the
tutor teacher model. The rest were allocated for schools, to support special education
and the use of digital tools. Over the past 20 years, the Finnish National Agency
for Education has annually allocated about e15 million for supporting the development of digital learning environments and for supporting teachers’ professional
learning of digi-pedagogy through training and development projects (Kumpulainen,
2017; Niemi, 2015). Altogether, 2,500 tutor-teacher positions were established with
funding from the Basic Education Forum (MEC, 2018a) in year 2017, and tutor
teachers were educated to support teachers in the use of digital tools, organize inclusive education and support the learning of transversal competences in their own
classrooms. A tutor teacher has less teaching hours than other teachers in order to
have time for supporting colleagues.
Finland has a robust digi-infrastructure, and Finnish people are active users of
digi-services. According to Digibarometer 2019 (Ali-Yrkkö et al., 2019), Finland
has ranked third in international comparisons over the last two years in use of the
internet; people younger than 55 report using the internet frequently (Tilastokeskus,
2019). According to the European Commission (2018), Finnish people rank highly
in the area of general digital skills and are global leaders in advanced digital skills.
According to the IEA International Computer and Information Literacy Study
2018 (Fraillon et al., 2019), all schools in Finland have access to the internet, and
93% of compulsory school students have an e-mail account for school-related use.
Both percentages are significantly above average among the countries participating
in the study. In Finland, almost all schools have versatile digital tools available,
including software for working with text, numbers and pictures, as well as learning
management systems. Altogether, 83% of schools reported that it is possible to have

4 Experiences of Moving Quickly to Distance Teaching and Learning …

109

digital tools in the classroom, and there are computers in one-third of all classrooms at
all times. In the use of the internet in education, Finland ranked fourth, after Sweden,
the United States, and Estonia (Ali-Yrkkö et al., 2019).
Tanhua-Piiroinen et al. (2019) conducted a national follow-up study considering
students’ and teachers’ digital competences using a representative sample. A total of
4,513 teachers and 4,135 s-grade, 4,992 fifth-grade and 5,046 eighth-grade students
completed the study. Consequently, the follow-up study provides a realistic picture of
the use of digital tools in teaching and learning before the pandemic. The follow-up
study included both survey questions and items measuring digital competence in real
situations. The actual situations were realized in a web environment. According to the
study, 66% of second-graders have access to a tablet or other digital tools at school,
while 11% of fifth-graders have their own tablet and 74% of them were able to use a
shared tablet or smartphone at school. However, computers and tablets are not used
every day in all classrooms. The use of digital tools has too often been traditional,
such as searching the internet, writing, and game-based learning. However, 43% of
second-graders and 44% of fifth-graders have tried more sophisticated uses of digital
devices, such as coding and robotics, at school.
According to the follow-up study (Tanhua-Piiroinen et al., 2019), eighth-grade
students have, on average, used daily digital tools for communication, social relationships, and entertainment. On average, they have used digital tools ‘sometimes’
for producing and sharing digital content. Boys used digital tools for digital learning
daily, but girls only once a week, on average. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD] (2019a) TALIS 2018 survey showed similar
findings related to the use of digital devices in Finland. However, there were differences between the competences related to the use of digital tools of different socioeconomic background students. This difference was recognized to increase the
inequality in Finland (Ahtiainen et al., 2020; Karvi, 2020). According to PISA 2018
(OECD, 2019b; Leino et al., 2019), Finnish 15-year-old students spent an average
of 74 min at school and two hours and 50 min out of school on the internet. About
50% of all students searched the internet for information; 65% of students completed
their homework with a computer at least twice a month and 90% of them used the
internet to complete their homework at least twice a month.
The IEA International Computer and Information Literacy Study 2018 (Fraillon
et al., 2019) evaluated the level of 15-year-old students’ digital skills via a digital
competence test. According to the study, the percentage of correct answers was
highest in Korea (77%), Denmark (72%) and Finland (70%) on various test items.
However, Saarinen et al. (2019) recognized the challenges of integrating digital tools
into learning. Teaching and learning methods used in compulsory education were
largely based on books, and digital tools were too often used just for completing
assignments.
According to the national follow-up study (Tanhua-Piiroinen et al., 2019), the
digital competence of teachers has markedly improved in terms of skills. Approximately 38% of teachers feel that they have an advanced level of digi-competences,
and only 10% of teachers feel that they lack digi-competences. A good command of

110

J. Lavonen and K. Salmela-Aro

digital competences among teachers is still more prevalent among the younger generations and male teachers. There is also variation in teachers’ competences between
municipalities. Teachers reported that they used digital learning environments on
average in half of the lessons and that they presented information with the help of
digital tools in most lessons. According to the International TALIS 2018 survey
(OECD, 2019a), Finnish teachers have made good progress with the use of digital
tools in teaching and learning and in their digi-competences.

4.4 Organisation of Teaching and Learning During
the Pandemic
The Finnish government, together with the president, declared a state of emergency in
line with the Emergency Powers Act1 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in mid-March
2020 to obtain emergency powers and centralize decision-making. This was the first
time a decision to use this act was made since the Second World War, and it was not
taken lightly in a country which is heavily committed to a decentralized decisionmaking process in education, health, and social care. The government decided to close
schools from March 18th until May 13th and then made the transition to distance
teaching and learning (Government, 2020). First-, second- and third-grade pupils
were allowed to go to school. According to the guidelines of the Finnish Agency for
Education (FNAE, 2020b), teaching and learning was aimed to continue according
to compulsory school curricula during the distance teaching period but organized
in alternative ways, including the use of various digital learning environments and
solutions and, when necessary, independent learning. However, on average one fourth
of the teachers lowered the level of requirements for the evaluation and grading
(Ahtiainen et al., 2020). This was considered acceptable by stakeholders and families
(HS, 2020a, b, c).
During the distance teaching period, the main platform for informing parents and
pupils in primary school was the communication platform Wilma.2 The platform
was recommended for giving homework, providing feedback, and communicating
with parents. The most common virtual learning environments or platforms used in
distance teaching were Moodle, Google Classrooms, Ville,3 Teams, O365, Skype,
and Zoom, depending on the education provider (YLE, 2020a). Education technology
companies provided e-learning materials at no cost to teachers, for an estimated cost
of more than e10 million, which is 15% of schools’ annual total budget for learning
materials (Suomen Kustannusyhdistys, 2020).
According to the Finnish National Agency for Education, primary, lower, and
upper secondary teachers changed their teaching to distance rather easily (FNAE,
2020b). The high levels of teacher and student digital competences and the quality

111

of the digital infrastructure in Finnish society supported this change. School laptops
were commonly loaned to students during the pandemic. However, it was estimated
at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic that tens of thousands of students were
without a computer. For this reason, a large-scale project, supported by the president
of Finland, was launched in which companies donated obsolete laptops directly
to students (Yleisradio [YLE], 2020a, b). Another reason for the rather successful
change to distance teaching was the tutor-teacher model, which was implemented in
2017 to support the professional learning of teachers, especially in learning to use
digi-tools and digi-platforms in their own classrooms.
After May 13th, children and adolescents returned to compulsory schools.
However, universities continued with distance learning and teaching. Municipalities (providers of education) implemented strict rules for preventing the spread of
COVID-19. For example, individuals were advised to wash their hands thoroughly,
and parents were not allowed to go inside classrooms. It was recommended that
students spend their entire school day with the same familiar group and have their
meals in the classroom, not in the lunchroom (Helsingin Sanomat [HS], 2020c).
The Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC, 2020) updated its instructions
related to the coronavirus pandemic at the beginning of August 2020. The ministry
emphasized that the most important measure was to prevent infections through
good hygiene, avoiding unnecessary close contact between students and arranging
teaching premises more spaciously than usual. Staff members were also instructed
to avoid gatherings, which meant, for example, that teachers should hold their meetings remotely. Meals were advised to be arranged individually with the pupils’ own
group. According to the recommendations, those who show symptoms of COVID-19
infection must remain at home. The recommendations have supported local actors in
seeking the best ways to organize schooling in a safe and well-functioning manner.
When the second wave of the pandemic in October 2020 was slowly coming
stronger, the government emphasized that the pandemic should be controlled
primarily under local and regional decisions and measures according to the Communicable Diseases Act (FNAE, 2020c). Therefore, the decisions related to COVID-19
restrictions, such as quarantines and changes to distance teaching, were allocated
to the local level, as usual. At the beginning of December 2020, some compulsory
schools changed, totally or partially, to the distance model. During the autumn, there
have been no plans to use the Emergency Powers Act again. This was because the
lessons learned during the springtime and one of the lowest infection rates in Europe.

4.5 School-Level Teaching and Learning Experiences
During the Pandemic
Ahtiainen et al. (2020) collected representative data in May and June 2020 from
principals and teachers from all Finnish municipalities as well as from students in
grades 4–10 and parents and guardians of students in grades 1–10. According to the

112

J. Lavonen and K. Salmela-Aro

survey, the rapid transition to the distance-learning period went surprisingly well.
However, students experienced distance learning in different ways; some students
estimated that distance learning suited them well, and they felt that learning at home
was more effective than at school. One-third of primary school students estimated
that they learned less than usual during the distance-learning period. Most teachers
felt that the workload was higher than in a normal situation. On the other hand,
teachers felt that their own digital skills had developed during the distance-teaching
period. Moreover, one-third of teachers reported that they have increased collaboration with other teachers. Nearly all principals reported that the school has provided
opportunities for teachers to share their experiences with distance-teaching arrangements. The challenges were most often related to students’ devices and teachers’
equipment and network connections. Nearly two-thirds of principals estimated that
at least half of the school’s teachers had reported pedagogical challenges in implementing distance learning. Parents and guardians have had to take more responsibility
for their children’s learning than usual, and about half of them felt that this increased
their stress.
Before publishing the evaluation report on the influence of the pandemic on
compulsory and secondary education, the Finnish Education Evaluation Centre
(Karvi, 2020) published the primary outcomes of the evaluation on their web page
and in a webinar. A representative random sample was collected from 70 compulsory school principals and 185 primary teachers in May. In addition, 1,792 students
in sixth and ninth grades answered the survey in October. Students rated physical
education as the easiest school subject and mathematics as the most difficult to learn
during the distance learning period. Students in primary and lower secondary schools
named life management, such as making a personal schedule, learning difficulties or
lack of support, and lack of opportunities or space to study at home as the main challenges during the distance learning period. Also, one-fifth of the teachers estimated
that students have had many challenges in planning their learning and in independent learning. However, students reported that retrieving information independently,
taking responsibility for their own learning and establishing a schedule for their
learning was engaging.
According to teacher and student evaluations, there was a lack of support, especially among special-needs students, and a minor lack of digital tools at students’
home. There were especially challenges among students who were not native Finnish
or Swedish speakers. The importance of cooperation between home and school was
emphasized in all municipalities, especially for identifying the need for student
support in compulsory education. However, the support offered to students varied
between municipalities (Karvi, 2020).
More than half of the teachers said that they had received support from their
employer during the pandemic. One-third of teachers reported that they needed more
guidance on organizing lessons remotely, and a quarter felt that they had not received
enough support and guidance in using the hardware and software. The role of one’s
home environment in supporting distance learning was emphasized by the teachers.
The distance learning period accelerated the development of teachers’ and students’
digital skills (Karvi, 2020).

113

The Karvi (2020) evaluation provides good examples of how teachers have started
to prepare themselves and students for the second wave of distance learning. Teachers
explain how they have used digital tasks in parallel with traditional teaching methods
in order to facilitate a possible transition to distance learning in the spring or autumn
2021 terms. There were also local-level decisions related to distance teaching of a
school or a classroom during the autumn of 2020. One teacher explained how he
had three students in the class in one of his groups while the rest of the group was
distance learning. The teacher taught those in the classroom while those at home
watched the video of the classroom, all at the same time.
In the research reports (Ahtiainen et al., 2020; Karvi, 2020) and in the Finnish
newspapers (HS, 2020a, b) there are several examples of how teachers and municipalities have overcome challenges related to distance teaching and created digipedagogy innovations. While challenges related to the distance teaching and learning
period have been discussed, examples of positive outcomes has been more common.
Teachers and directors of education in the municipality level have described, for
example, the following experiences:
– Some of our students are really skilled distance learners and they are able to achieve
their goals independently. There are also students who have had problems with learning
or social control and self-control (director of education in a city).
– The readiness of parents to help students during the distance learning varied. For example,
immigrant background parents, who had lack of language skills were in trouble (director
of education in a city).
– In the spring, we were able to share laptops to all students. I always started the distance
learning lessons with a video connection and checked that everyone’s connection was
working and students were in front of the laptop. During my lessons I used break-outrooms and other approaches, which supported collaborative learning (lower secondary
biology teacher).
– During autumn, I used Google Classroom in parallel to normal teaching in order to
facilitate a possible transition to distance learning (lower secondary geography teacher).
– Remote meetings engaged second-graders in learning. It looked like they had forgotten
that they were in a distance class (primary teacher).
– Some of the students’ workload should be lightened and some would like to be given more
to do. However, I try to avoid pressure to families from the school side (primary teacher).

Students have described, for example, the following experiences:
– After the school switched to distance learning, I got an idea and sent a suggestion to my
class WhatsApp group: “I will make a discord server” (upper secondary student).
– We used Google Meet as a learning platform. It was working well (lower secondary
student).

4.6 Teacher, Principal and Student Well-Being During
the Pandemic
Salmela-Aro et al. (2020) collected data from all Finnish principals during April and
May 2020 on digital skills, work-related well-being, and remote learning (n = 644,

114

J. Lavonen and K. Salmela-Aro

response rate 54%). Three groups of principals were identified: engaged (36%),
high stress (46%) and burnout (18%) groups. The results further showed that the
number of burnout principals had increased and the number of engaged principals
had decreased. Engaged principals appraised that teachers had good digital skills and
that the change to distance teaching was smooth, whereas the burned-out principals
felt that teachers had challenges with their digital skills and that the transition to
distance learning was challenging.
Data among teachers was also collected both in the spring and late fall of 2020
(Salmela-Aro et al., 2020). Both times, about 1,500 teachers completed the questions
about remote teaching, work-related well-being, and digital skills. During the spring
of 2020, the number of engaged teachers was 41.8%; engaged but exhausted, 11.2%;
at risk of burnout, 37.2%; and severe burnout, 9.8%. The situation was even more
stressful among the teachers in the Fall, as the number of engaged teachers was only
about 30% and severe burnout about 20%. The better the teachers’ digital skills,
the more likely they were to be engaged, whereas the more digital challenges they
experienced, the more likely they were to feel burned out. In addition, the more the
teachers felt that families were suffering from COVID-19 and had difficulties with
remote learning, the more likely the teachers were to feel stressed or even burned out.
Thus, the inequalities among families had severe implications for teacher well-being.
There is also evidence about the variation in the support families can offer to their
students learning at home in Finland. The higher the socioeconomic status of the
family is, it is more common for the students’ engagement in online reading (OECD,
2019b; Leino et al., 2019). Unfortunately, the teachers in the burnout or risk of
burnout groups were most likely to leave the teaching profession, thus demonstrating
the severe implications of burnout. However, principals’ support and motivating
leadership was one of the key supporting aspects of teachers’ well-being.
Even before the pandemic, student engagement in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning was a deep concern globally, and several
major reports by the OECD (2019b) connected engagement with disinterest in STEM
and its attractiveness as a career option. Recently, in examining the impact of the
pandemic on learning, several surveys have shown that students report feeling disinterested, bored, and socially isolated when spending long hours in virtual classes.
These surveys have given rise to a new worldwide concern of not only ‘learning
loss,’ but also well-being loss. Our view of academic engagement in STEM is situational, and not all activities are likely to have the same effect on students’ social,
emotional, and academic learning. The approach identifies three constructs critical
for enhancing student engagement that are grounded in the psychological literature:
interest, skill, and challenge. Interest is the psychological predisposition for a specific
activity, topic, or object; skill is the mastery of a set of specific tasks; and challenge is
the willingness to take on a difficult, somewhat unpredictable course of action. When
students are fully engaged, they tend to concentrate and feel in control (Schneider
et al., 2020). When academic interests, skills and challenges are in balance, these
moments are called optimal learning moments (OLMs), or situationally specific times
when a student is so deeply engrossed in a task that it feels as if time is flying by. This
idea is similar to how Csikszentmihalyi (1990) describes flow as being completely

4 Experiences of Moving Quickly to Distance Teaching and Learning …

115

immersed in an activity; for this study, we restrict the definition of flow to classroom
situations that elevate students’ academic engagement and are positively related to
social and emotional learning. Our research shows that OLMs occur about 15–20%
of the time in STEM lessons; our interest is to examine how often they occur when
students are learning online. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the results
showed that OLMs happened only about 5% of the time. (Salmela-Aro et al., 2020).

4.7 Discussion
In the spring of 2020, the shift to distance teaching and learning happened rather
smoothly; teachers’ and students’ digital competences developed, and local distance
teaching, co-teaching and digi-pedagogy approaches were created. This view was
emphasized, especially in the Ministry of Education and Culture and National Agency
of Education reports (FNAE, 2020c). However, the distance learning period weakened the equality of teaching and the conditions for learning, especially, the teachers
reported that they were not able to support the engagement and well-being of all
learners, especially students with special needs. In addition, some of the students
lacked parents and peer support and informal collaboration sessions. (Ahtiainen et al.,
2020; Karvi, 2020). Moreover, the level of burnout among principals, teachers and
students increased, and the level of engagement decreased (Salmela-Aro et al., 2020).
Teachers and students experienced distance learning in different ways; for some, it
was more stressful than studying at school, while others felt that their well-being
improved. The most challenging situation has been among special-needs students
because of the lack of support. However, these students were able to continue learning
at school with the help of special-needs teachers. In addition, students who faced an
educational transition period during COVID-19 suffered more, such as on evaluations
and exams.
There are several reasons why the shift to distance teaching was overall rather
successful, although there were challenges with equity. First, all Finnish teachers are
educated in masters-level programs, and their digital skills and digi-pedagogy competences are at an appropriate level. In practice, all primary and secondary teachers are
qualified and have a master’s-level education and as a part of this education the
teachers have developed willingness and competence for continuous professional
learning. According to a recent national follow-up study (Tanhua-Piiroinen et al.,
2019), about 50% of secondary and primary teachers evaluated that they have basic
digital competences and about 40% advanced competences. König et al. (2020)
found similar results based on a survey they conducted in May and June 2020 in
Germany. They recognized that teachers’ digi-competence and opportunities to learn
those competences are instrumental in adapting to online teaching. Quality teachers,
combined with local level decision making in decentralized education system have
made it possible to make decisions at the teacher level, how to organize distance
teaching, what kind of digi-pedagogy is used and how teachers are collaborating.
Therefore, the pandemic provided an opportunity for teachers to experiment with

116

J. Lavonen and K. Salmela-Aro

new ways of teaching. The developed digi-pedagogy methods have been used as
a part of classroom teaching during the autumn. There are two main reasons for
teachers’ appropriate digi-pedagogy competences in addition to their master-level
education. There have been digital strategies, both separate from and integrated
into government programs and school curricula since the 1980s, which have guided
teachers and creators of learning materials and platforms. Second, there have been
resources for implementing these strategic ideas in terms of support to teachers’
professional learning. However, if there was a lack of digital competences among
teachers in a school, it was one of the main reasons for principals’ stress during the
COVID-19 pandemic.
It is clear that the digi-skills of students should be continuously developed,
although the public and policy debate around students’ use of digi-tools and media
has long been shaped by the persistence of two myths: the perception of children as
‘digital natives’ who are innately tech savvy just because they grew up with digital
technologies, and the contrasting preoccupation with children as innocent and vulnerable subjects in need of protection from online risks (Barbovschi & Marinescu, 2013).
Accordingly, between 2000 and 2010, the research agenda prioritized topics such as
children’s access to and use of the internet and their exposure to online risks. The
tension between children as competent users or innocent victims remained implicit
and unresolved until the debate moved beyond the initial focus solely on risks and
started to address the opportunities and challenges of the internet and digital technologies on children’s agency, rights, and well-being (Livingstone & Third, 2017;
Livingstone et al., 2018). It is within this more comprehensive framework that situates the internet as an integral component of children’s everyday life through which
children engage with the world (Livingstone et al., 2018) and understanding what
skills enable children to fully harness online opportunities and cope with risks has
become crucial. Recently, in a large European Union (EU) Horizon 2020 youth digital
skills project, four key digital skills were identified: technical, information search,
interaction skills, and creative production skills (ySkills, 2020). The learning of these
skills is recognized as a goal in the Finnish Basic school curriculum (FNBE, 2014).
The third reason for the successful transition to distance teaching was the level of
good digital infrastructure in Finland. According to the IEA International Computer
and Information Literacy Study 2018 (Fraillon et al., 2019), 99% of schools in
Finland have access to the internet, and 93% of students have an e-mail account
for school-related use. In Finland, almost all schools have versatile digital tools
available, including software for working with text, numbers, and pictures as well as
learning management systems. Laptops were loaned to students who did not have a
laptop at home, and companies also donated laptops to students. König et al. (2020)
also emphasized the availability of digital tools as a precondition for success in
distance learning.
The level of digital infrastructure at the school level could be compared to digital
infrastructure in society. One recent international comparative study conducted by
the International Digital Economy and Society Index (I-DESI, 2018) of EU Member

4 Experiences of Moving Quickly to Distance Teaching and Learning …

117

States and 17 non-EU countries aimed to measure the general level of digital infrastructure and use of digital tools in society through cross-national representative quantitative surveys. The index focuses on five core dimensions: connectivity, use of
internet services, integration of digital technology, digital public service, and human
capital (in terms of digital skills). Overall, findings from the I-DESI show that while
on a global scale Europe compares well with other major economies, significant
differences persist among European countries. Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands,
and Denmark were recognized as the most advanced European digital economies,
while Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, and Poland scored the lowest. Consequently, there
is a correlation between the level of digital infrastructure in the education sector and
in society.
The fourth reason for the successful transition to distance teaching is the strategic
planning of digital teaching and learning and the use of resources for implementing
these plans. As previously mentioned, Finland has had both separate digital strategies and digital strategies that have been integrated into government programs and
school curricula since the 1980s. These strategies have been designed collaboratively, accounting for many stakeholders, such as teachers, municipality unions, and
organizations, at the national level. The process orientation of the strategy work has
included the preparation of a local-level interpretation of the national level strategy
(Mahlamäki-Kultanen, et al., 2014). This local-level interpretation has supported
teachers in the adoption of new ideas. There have always been development projects
and support for teachers’ professional learning in the context of strategies, especially
digi-pedagogy. For example, the program of the current government and the Right
to Learn project emphasize the importance of education equality and equity and the
development of digi-pedagogy. New governments have continued the education policies and measures of the previous governments. This type of long-term continuity
in policy is important for schools, teachers, and students. The policy and planned
measures are to a great extent accepted by stakeholders, such as the Association of
Finnish Local and Regional Authorities (2019), Finnish Education Employers (FEE;
2019) and the Trade Union of Education (OAJ; 2019). The FEE even emphasizes
the importance of quality support to students with special needs or pupils at risk of
marginalization/exclusion to achieve high-quality reading, writing and mathematics
competences.
In order to be ready for the next crisis in education, important policy and school
practice issues must be addressed. Most important is to continue to follow a longterm education policy that focuses on equity and quality of education. Equity means
that all teachers, including special-needs teachers, should continuously learn digipedagogy skills; likewise, all students should learn digi-skills. Digital platforms
and digi-environments should also be used in classroom teaching. Second, teachers
and students should have easy access to digi-tools. Education providers and schools
should continuously update these digital tools and infrastructure. In addition, we need
to promote the socio-emotional skills of grit, curiosity, resilience, emotional regulation and social competence among students, teachers, and principals to support their
engagement and well-being. These are the key resources buffering individuals from
stress during future challenging demands. Preparedness for possible future setbacks

118

can promote both students’ and teachers’ well-being and engagement. Moreover,
the most vulnerable groups, such as those at risk of marginalization, those experiencing educational transition or those with special needs, require more resources and
support. This view was especially emphasized in the study of Ahtiainen et al. (2020):
support of students who have special needs, either with virtual tools or face-to-face
instruction, is essential in the learning process. The learner needs the support of both
the teacher and the group, and this can be done in many different ways.
The most important aspect of the policy is the continuing of quality teacher education. Teacher education programs should be continuously improved and account for
changes in society and labour markets, like the increasing use of AI in all sectors.
High-quality teacher education and its continuous development is the only way
to guarantee that teachers can easily switch to distance teaching or make other
rapid changes at school. Teachers’ continuous learning of digi-skills, including
the skills needed in the use of digital platforms, could be supported by continuous learning services and teachers’ collaborative professional learning activities.
Similarly, Darling-Hammond and Hyler (2020) argue that investing in high-quality
teacher education, transforming teachers’ professional learning opportunities to
match current and future needs, supporting the mentoring and development of new
teachers, and creating time for educators to collaborate with each other and key partners is critical. Moreover, principal education needs to be updated to include new
competencies to lead distance teaching and learning.
In addition to formal continuous learning and the support of tutor-teachers,
teachers benefit from local and national networking. An example of a network is
the Innokas Network.4 It is a teacher network from 100 municipalities that encourages schools to arrange their own activities supporting the learning of 21st-century
competences, including digital competences. Another important topic within the
network is inclusive education through the use of digital tools and the personalization of learning (Sormunen, 2020). The Innokas Network supports schools by
arranging trainings, consulting, and events in different parts of Finland. Today, the
network comprises over 600 schools all over Finland. Another good example of how
teachers are supported in the use of digital tools and in inclusive education is the
tutor-teacher model. Some 2,500 tutor-teacher positions were established in Finnish
municipalities and financed by the Ministry of Education and Culture.5 In total, e30
million was allocated in 2017 and 2018 to help municipalities hire and train tutor
teachers. Since 2018, there has been some financing available from the state, but
municipalities have also financed this model of support themselves. In a similar way,
Moorhouse et al. (2020) argue based on distance learning experiences in Hong Kong
during the COVID-19 pandemic that school-based professional support is essential.
Based on the national surveys completed during the pandemic, practical guidelines
could be offered if distance learning is implemented again. More attention should be
given to supporting students individually and to guiding students in peer support and
collaboration (c.f., Ahtiainen et al., 2020). Teacher collaboration and networking

should also be supported. Teachers at the same grade level in primary school or
those who teach the same subject at lower secondary schools could benefit from
such collaboration. They can plan lessons together, and one teacher could teach the
lesson to all students in the same grade. Others can support the education of students
with special needs (c.f., Iivari et al., 2020). International collaboration is also needed
to identify the best practices for distance teaching and learning and addressing future
crises.

Covid-19 and Education on the Front
Lines in Japan: What Caused Learning
Disparities and How Did the Government
and Schools Take Initiative?

Sae Nakae, and Kan Hiroshi Suzuki
Abstract While the COVID-19 pandemic posed unprecedented challenges to the
education system of Japan, the government and schools took necessary measures to
combat the outbreak and ensure student learning continued. The temporary school
closure, following the state of emergency, continued for 2 months, from April through
May of 2020. Even after the declaration was lifted in May 2020, schools adopted
the new-normal way of operations. By shortening the summer break and holding
alternative classes, elementary, junior, and senior high schools, except for universities, returned to normal while the COVID-19 pandemic was settling down, and
ended the semester regularly in December 2020. The temporary closure, however,
led to a huge disparity in implementing online classes, depending on availability of
personal laptops in schools. Many private schools, and a substantial number of public
schools established by innovative local governments, such as Saga Prefecture and
Shibuya Ward, were successful in transitioning to online learning. However, most
public schools were unable to hold online courses due to the lack of facilities both in
schools and at student households. Aware of the disparities, the government brought
forward a policy initiative to distribute personal PCs to all elementary and junior
high school students, and to supply high-speed IT networks to each school, with an
expected completion of March 2021. In this chapter, we will explore various disparities in depth, particularly underlining the relationship between ICT environments
in schools and the issue of school founders. Additionally, we provide an overview

on how the government and schools coped with the crisis, capitalized on the policy
initiatives, and utilized available resources. As a concluding remark, we aim to leave
room for optimism by taking this pandemic as an opportunity to reconsider and
reimagine education. Note: This chapter has nothing to do with operations of organizations that respective authors belong to, and the views expressed in this chapter

5.1 Introduction
In the past decade, Japan has experienced a series of catastrophes, among which the
Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in 2011 still remain a vivid part of the country’s
memory. Despite a number of natural disasters, the government and people have
nevertheless been coping well and fighting back against the difficulties. Despite
these experiences, however, the COVID-19 pandemic posed formidable challenges
across the nation’s healthcare, economy, politics, and above all, education system.
In this chapter, we aim to describe how Japan dealt with this unprecedented crisis,
and particularly aim to portray the response of the government and of schools to the
pandemic.
In the first section, we overview the timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic. What
marked the case of Japan was that the school closure happened only once and
continued for a relatively short period. Even so, the impact of the closure caused
immense damage to student learning opportunities. In the second section, we unpack
the mechanism of how disparity was produced along different lines in Japan’s education system. While presenting the detailed overview of the disparities, however, we
also portray the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology’s
policy initiatives and various supportive measures aimed at closing learning gaps.
While this crisis had detrimental effects, particularly on vulnerable populations, such
as single parents, it is important not to overlook the positive sides of the pandemic
and take this event as an opportunity to rethink education. In the concluding section,
we will present implications for future policymaking.

5.2 The COVID-19 Pandemic and Japan’s Response
We will first overview the government and school responses to the COVID-19
pandemic. In the case of Japan, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science
and Technology (hereafter, MEXT) promptly provided policies and guidelines on
how to deal with the pandemic, which schools followed in a rather uniform way.
On January 28, 2020, the government of Japan classified COVID-19 as a designated infectious disease, which require specific medical treatments, epidemiological
investigation, and outbreak control. In the beginning of February, the government
faced the outbreak within a foreign cruise ship at the port in Japan and dealt with

5 Covid-19 and Education on the Front Lines in Japan: What Caused …

127

the immigration procedures for those infected with COVID-19. Although the MEXT
expressed reluctance at the beginning, starting on March 2, elementary, junior high,
and senior high schools across the nation closed in a coordinated way due to the
request of then-Prime Minister Abe. However, the impact of this school closure
was relatively small because it coincided with spring break. Facing the spread of
the infection and continuing school closures, on March 31 the MEXT announced
the acceleration of the Global and Innovation Gateway for All (hereinafter, GIGA)
School Initiative, to complete the distribution of PC/Tablet devices to all elementary
and junior high school students by March 2021. The original timeline of the initiative
was to distribute within 4 years, starting from the fiscal year 2020.
On April 7, at the very beginning of the school year, a state of emergency was
declared in 7 prefectures (out of 47 in total) covering mostly urban cities (including
Tokyo). While schools continued to be closed in those prefectures, the state of emergency was extended across the nation on April 16, and thus most schools went into
a temporary closure. The school closure, despite being temporary, led to a huge
disparity in student learning between schools. For example, some public schools had
been implementing online education since before the pandemic, and some private
schools were able to set up online education immediately after the temporary closure.
These schools were able to deliver online classes on the premise of one device per
student. On the other hand, most of the public elementary and junior high schools,
without online education in place, had to distribute learning materials by sending
in hard copies to students at home, resulting in a noticeable gap between public
and private schools. Nevertheless, some exceptional cases existed, wherein public
schools had allocated one device to each student a few years ago and had lent Wifi
routers to improve the network environments even in the student homes. These cases
include Saga Prefecture and Shibuya Ward in Tokyo. While these were exceptions,
since there are 249 elementary and junior high schools in Saga (Board of Education,
Sage Prefecture, 2017), and 34 in Shibuya (Shibuya City, n.d.), these cases highlight
that a substantial number of public schools had been ready for online education.
On May 4, the state of emergency was extended until the end of the month, and
most schools remained closed. Shortly afterwards, on May 14, the state of emergency
was lifted in 39 prefectures, followed by the Greater Tokyo Area on May 25. Schools
began to resume in June, but in major cities, many schools took measures to shorten
in-class hours to reduce contact between students. In addition, there were many
schools that divided classes into two groups and introduced staggered hours for
attendance. Meanwhile, in less impacted regions, schools returned to normal with
a regular attendance of students. In July and August, most schools shortened their
summer break and held alternative classes to make up for the delay in the curriculum
due to the temporary closure. Fortunately, by the beginning of the second semester
in September, most schools were able to catch up and return to normal, successfully
reaching the end of the semester in December.
When the COVID-19 outbreak temporarily waned in September, the government of Japan launched the Go To Travel campaign, where the government partially
covered the travel costs of citizens visiting less impacted regions. This policy intended
to revitalize the tourism industry, which was facing significant damage. However,

128

K. Iwabuchi et al.

the number of daily infected cases began to resurge around November, resulting in
the nationwide outbreak. On January 7, 2021, the government declared the state of
emergency for the Greater Tokyo Area, and on January 13, extended the declaration
to 7 prefectures. This declaration focused mainly on restaurants, and thereby did
not require any school closure. On January 16 and 17, 550,000 high school students
were able to take the Common Test for University Admissions as originally scheduled
(Table 5.1).

5.3 Home-Based Learning During the School Closure
and MEXT’s Policy Initiatives
In Japan, thus far, school closure has only happened once, and for a relatively short
period. The efforts of schools and the MEXT enabled the delay in covering the
curriculum to be resolved by the end of summer 2020. Even so, the school closure
disrupted student learning, and the impact was disproportionately larger in some
regions, and among certain types of schools. This section will unpack the mechanism of how this disparity emerged, and delineate key factors contributing to
this disparity. First, we provide the contextual information on Japan’s decentralized education system, where schools are founded and run by different kinds of
actors. Then, we move on to describe disparities in student home-based learning
during the school closure, first by school type, and second by prefecture. While illustrating the learning gap, we draw from surveys and highlight potential key factors
in explaining the disparities. While the COVID-19 pandemic undoubtedly disrupted
student learning, we also highlight policy initiatives from the MEXT that have the
potential to alleviate the negative impact of the pandemic.

5.3.1 Background: Japan’s Education System
Before diving into a description of the pandemic’s impact, we will first provide a
brief summary of Japan’s education system. As of 2020, the Japanese education
system houses over 15 million children and students, from kindergarten to high
schools (MEXT, 2020b). The levels of elementary and junior high schools constitute compulsory education. While the national curriculum stipulates what students
learn, students rarely repeat grades, despite whether they have actually learned the
curriculum or not, particularly at the level of compulsory education1 (Ikeda & García,
2014). This suggests students, despite the school closure and loss of learning opportunities, would be nonetheless promoted to the next grade. The senior high school
1 In Japan, compulsory education includes two levels: (i) six years of primary education (corre-

sponding to 6–11 years old); (ii) three years of lower secondary education (corresponding to
12–14 years old).

enrollment rate is about 98% and the dropout rate is less than 2%. While selection
upon entry (typically in the form of exams) is required in public senior high schools,
only a few of these schools are highly competitive.
While there exist national, public, and private schools in Japan, only 0.6% of
students are in national elementary schools, and 1.3% in private elementary schools,
as of 2020 (MEXT, 2020b). In other words, Japan’s education system is predominantly characterized by public schools. Likewise, only 0.9% of students are in
national junior high schools, and 7.5% in private schools (although this figure is
much higher in Tokyo with 25.2% being students in private junior high schools)
(MEXT, 2020b). In contrast, the proportion of students in private schools is larger at
the level of senior high schools (32.9%), whereas only 0.3% of students are enrolled
in their national counterparts (MEXT, 2020b). In Tokyo, the ratio is even higher,
with 56.4% of students in private senior high schools (MEXT, 2020b).
It is important to note the heterogeneity even among public schools. In addition to elementary and junior high schools, which have existed since the inception of the modern schooling system, different types of schools were allowed to
be established, which are compulsory education schools and secondary schools. A
compulsory education school is one integrating an elementary and junior high school,
whereas a secondary school is the combination of a junior and senior high school. The
latter requires exams upon entry even at the level of junior high schools, unlike traditional counterparts. Lastly, special-needs education schools were set up for children
with disabilities, covering elementary through high school.
Similar to the US, Japan’s education system is decentralized across three layers of
administrative divisions: (i) national, (ii) prefectural, and (iii) municipal, respectively.
As described later, different layers of local governments are in charge of different
types of schools. For example, it is local municipalities that open and maintain public
elementary and junior high schools. Remarkably, however, teacher salary is paid by
prefectural and national governments (the former covering two-thirds, while the latter
one-third). In this way, it is possible for teachers to receive similar salaries, despite
fluctuations in the size of funding among different local municipalities.

5.3.2 Disparity in Home-Based Learning During School
Closure by School Type
As mentioned above, different school types exist within the system of education.
Accordingly, the proportion of schools providing online education differs by category
of the school types. As shown in Table 5.2, among public elementary and junior high
schools, only 5% of the schools helped students with their home learning through
interactive online lectures in April (the beginning of the temporary closure). By June
(the end of the closure), as Table 5.3 illustrates, the number increased to 8% of
elementary schools and 10% of junior high schools, which nonetheless indicates the
implementation was rather stagnant. In contrast, a higher proportion of schools of
the other types offered online lectures. According to Table 5.3, 17% of compulsory
education schools, 47% of senior high schools, even 70% of secondary schools, and
40% of special-needs education schools did so.
The discrepancy by school type, and particularly the tendency where secondary
schools were more successful in providing online instruction, are visible in other
items listed in Table 5.3 , such as the utilization of TV programs, or of other digital
learning materials. For example, while only about 35% of elementary and junior high
schools used TV programs, 50% of secondary schools did so.
We argue that this gap by school type might be linked to education governance
structure, particularly, the issue of who established the school. As mentioned earlier,
the administrative divisions of Japan consist of two layers: the level of prefectures and
of municipalities. Each administrative division organizes its own local government,

although that of a municipality is usually smaller than that of a prefecture. According
to the School Education Law, every school has to be established either by the national,
or local government (of prefectures or of municipalities), or school organizations
(usually in the case of private schools). School type differs based on who serves as a
school founder. In the case of public elementary and junior high schools, it is local
municipalities that establish schools, and therefore manage school funding.
In the case of secondary schools, on the other hand, it is often a prefectural
government that founds schools. These secondary schools, with greater funding,
compete with private schools and strive to proactively promote digitalization of
education to serve as a model school in their respective region. Likewise, most
compulsory education schools might have better ICT facilities for a different reason.
They were often established through a merger of existing elementary and junior
high schools. Concomitant with the merger, they rebuilt the facilities such as school
buildings and renovated their ICT environments.

5 Covid-19 and Education on the Front Lines in Japan: What Caused …

133

In addition to the issue of school founders, we believe that parents’ socioeconomic
status (SES) might be another key factor in the disparity among different types of
schools. While secondary schools are public, they require entrance exams unlike other
public junior high schools. As is often the case with selective schools, households
sending their children to secondary schools tend to have higher socio-economic
backgrounds. Arguably, children in those households might have better access to
ICT devices and the Internet.
Differences in parent SES can also play a key role in explaining the gap between
public and private schools in general. While there is not enough data on private
schools readily available, many 6-year private secondary schools are in urban areas,
and those schools tend to compete with public secondary schools for student recruitment. This suggests that the level of education (including ICT facilities) should be
equivalent or higher than that in public secondary schools. Furthermore, while the
number of private elementary schools are small in Japan, students with a relatively
wealthy family background enroll in those schools. Capitalizing on the higher tuition,
those schools are able to set up facilities for online education.
In contrast, public elementary and junior high schools are struggling with the lack
of technology and devices necessary for online education, not just in schools but also
in student households. If such disparity exists within the same class or school, most
public schools adjust the level and method of education to a student of the lowest SES
status to ensure equality. Hence, in these schools, economic and social challenges
present in some families can directly influence a delay in education for the entire
school, which eventually amplifies the disparity among different types of schools.

5.3.3 Disparity in Home-Based Learning During School
Closure by Prefecture
In addition to the gap by school type, there exists a regional disparity in student
learning during the pandemic. In this section, we illuminate the learning gap at the
level of prefectures, drawing on two surveys conducted by the Cabinet Office, and
MEXT, respectively.
Even before the launch of the GIGA School project, local governments were
installing ICT devices and high-speed network in public schools, funded through
local taxes, as well as tax allocations from the central government. The allocated tax
from the central government was designed and calculated to help local governments
in digitalizing their education. However, since the central government did not have
any legally binding power as to how local governments would spend the allocated
money, not all local governments used it for the intended purpose. In other words,
the discrepancy related to ICT environments already existed before the Coronavirus
outbreak.
Figure 5.1 presents the ratio of the number of laptops per student in each prefecture. As is visible in the figure, the ratio differs remarkably by prefecture. In Saga

Source MEXT (2020a). Note The vertical axis denotes the ratio of the number of PCs per student in
public schools. Smaller number indicate more devices are available for the given number of students

Prefecture, for example, the ratio is less than two, showing that more ICT devices
have been distributed to students in Saga Prefecture than in other prefectures. While
Saga Prefecture serves as an exemplary case at the prefectural level, Shibuya Ward
(Tokyo) and Tsukuba City (Ibaraki Prefecture) are model cases at the municipal
level.2 Shibuya Ward even offered support for home-based Internet access for student
learning.
Given the difference in ICT environments shown above, the school closure should
have had differing impacts on students, depending on the prefectures where they lived.
To examine this disparity, we drew on a survey that the Cabinet Office conducted
during May and June 2020, which coincided with the school closure. The Cabinet
Office intended to capture the change in people’s ways of thinking and behavior
in daily life due to the COVID-19 pandemic (Cabinet Office, 2020). The survey
carried out online targeted 10,128 registered people over the age of 15 (Cabinet
Office, 2020). We used a question on what kind of instructions respondents’ youngest
children received during the pandemic.3 Figure 5.2 shows the proportion of children
receiving some forms of online education by prefecture.
Among all the prefectures, on average, 10.2% of students received online education during the school closure. Notably, as shown in Fig. 5.2, the number in Saga
Prefecture is much higher (66.7%) than the average, although the sample size is
rather small. Another limitation to this survey is that it did not distinguish public
and private schools. Hence, we cannot really compare this survey with that by the
MEXT, because the latter explored only public schools.
2 Consult the Sect. 5.1 to see the number of schools in these school districts.
3 See Appendix A for more details on questions used for this analysis.

the School Closure (n = 1,363) Source Cabinet Office (2020). Note Some forms of online education

or online learning materials received from schools for home-based learning. The total number of
prefectures is 47, and the figure in parentheses beside the name of a given prefecture represents the
number of respondents in the prefecture. Error bars indicate the 95% confidence intervals

While another survey needs to be done to directly reveal the relationship between
the ICT facilities (particularly, the ratio of laptops per student) and implementation of
online learning, it is highly probable that the level of ICT environments by prefecture
leads to the regional disparity in student home-based learning (HBL). Differences
in digital investment in schools, such as one device per student and high-speed
Internet, seems to indeed be a common factor in explaining the gap by school type
or by prefecture. In the following section, we highlight the MEXT’s initiative to
potentially close the student learning gap.

5.3.4 The GIGA School Initiative as the Policy Solution
As mentioned in the first section, the national government, in response to the
pandemic, decided to advance the GIGA School Initiative ahead of its original
schedule. By the end of March 2021, all elementary and junior high schools will allocate one device per student and install high-speed networks. Using a subsidy from
the national government, each local government will be in charge of implementing
this project on the ground. Furthermore, local municipalities will take additional
measures, such as lending mobile Wi-Fi devices to households without Internet. As
mentioned thus far, the discrepancy in school funding is linked to the issue of school

136

founders with less financial resources. By means of the national government’s financial assistance, this initiative is likely to narrow such a gulf existing among different
kinds of schools and among prefectures.
The GIGA initiative places its primary emphasis on the hardware of online education. In terms of educational content, we would like to underscore that abundant
resources are available in Japan and draw particular attention to programs by the Japan
Broadcasting Corporation (Nippon Hōsō Kyōkai, in Japanese; hereinafter, NHK).
Since 1959, the NHK began a free channel dedicated solely to education, and have
created quality educational programs, some of which covered school curriculum.
Taking advantage of its experience and capacity to develop educational content, the
corporation started the NHK for School in 2011. This platform provides various
online educational contents, and more importantly, is compliant with the Curriculum
Guidelines (i.e., the national curriculum). From 2015, the NHK for School began to
provide programs helping students learn through the medium of tablet devices. If
ICT environments were in place, students would have been able to enjoy the benefit
of these NHK programs, even during the sudden school closure.
Certainly, there is concern over whether students can learn by relying on online
education. In fact, a research team led by Professor Jun Nakahara of Rikkyo University investigated student learning during the school closure in May and revealed
62% of the students (out of 760) did not know what to do during the school closure
(Takasaki et al., 2020). Acknowledging the lack of student agency, however, the
MEXT has made revisions to the Curriculum Guideline in 2017 to place a greater
emphasis on this aspect of student knowledges, skills, and attitudes (Shirai, 2020).
While the implementation of the new Curriculum Guideline is still underway, once
school education becomes fully aligned, students exercising their agency will be able
to tap into the rich educational resources available to them in these newly installed
ICT environments.

5.3.5 MEXT’s Additional Supportive Policy Measures
Besides the GIGA School initiative, the MEXT has been implementing various
supportive measures, which this section will overview below. As shown in Table 5.4,
the MEXT’s responses to COVID-19 can be grouped into 3 categories: (i) support
for students facing economic hardships, (ii) assistance with children’s learning, and
(iii) disbursement of ICT devices and relevant services. Detailed explanation on each
policy item will not be covered in our analysis, however, we will highlight the fact that
the MEXT promptly executed necessary measures under rapidly changing circumstances. In Appendix B, we include the list of the MEXT’s initiatives for readers’
reference.

5.4 Threat to Learning Opportunities and Room
for Optimism Amidst the Pandemic
The previous section analyzed the disparity stemming from differences in education
governance structure. The pandemic indeed exacerbated the pre-existing disparities,
not just at the municipal level, but also in various social groups, particularly the
vulnerable population. Various studies reported detrimental effects of the COVID-19
crisis on households with lower socioeconomic status (García & Weiss, 2020; Yarrow,
Masood, & Afkar, 2020). In the first half of this section, we draw particular attention
to single-parent households. During the school closure, when parents were absent
at home, children had to face home learning without parental support. Additionally,
if single parents lost their jobs due to the worsening economic situation, financial
shortages deprived children of ICT tools that provide access to online education.
Children in single-parent households, therefore, faced an even greater threat to their
learning.

138

K. Iwabuchi et al.

In the latter half of this section, however, we portray different sides of the COVID19 Pandemic. In response to the school closure, the policy initiative to distribute
personal ICT devices was accelerated, as mentioned above. In addition to this development, we will sketch a few silver linings of this crisis, and how they have the
potential to ameliorate the current disparity of access to education among students.

5.4.1 Deprivation of Learning Opportunities from Children
in Single-Parent Households
The Japan Institute for Labor Policy and Training (JILPT) led a survey to clarify the
impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic, particularly on single-parent households. The
survey highlights the severe distress single-parent families faced amidst the crisis.
While comparing 500 single parents with 500 non-single parents, 60.8% of single
parents reported that they were struggling to make ends meet toward the end of the
year, and 35.6% were unable to buy food (JILPT, 2020). In the case of non-single
parents, the figures were much lower (47.6% and 26.4%, respectively), indicating
that single parents were in dire straits (JILPT, 2020).
Other surveys call attention to how financial hardship hampered learning opportunities for children in single-parent households. A survey conducted by Save the
Children, Japan, revealed 32% of single-parent families in Tokyo answered that
their children “may drop out of high schools” due to financial reasons (Save the
Children Japan, 2020). Surprisingly, another survey led by an NPO, Single-Mother
Forum, and researchers revealed about 40% of households with children in junior
high school or older had no computers or tablets available at home (Single Mothers
Survey Project Team, 2020). In addition, about 30% of households did not have
access to the Internet at home or had to limit data usage (Single Mothers Survey
Project Team, 2020). This result matches those from a survey by Aomori Prefecture,
in which 36.8% of single-parent households (95.4% are single mothers) answered
that the environment for online classes at home was “not good or not at all [good]”
(Future of Children Division, Aomori Prefecture, 2020). These households would
not have been able to benefit from online education even if it had been implemented
during the school closure.

5.4.2 Ray of Hope for Education Amidst the COVID-19
Pandemic
The above snapshot of single-parent households implies detrimental effects of the
pandemic on social groups with low SES. This aspect cannot be emphasized enough
and requires us to monitor future interventions. However, it cannot be overlooked

5 Covid-19 and Education on the Front Lines in Japan: What Caused …

139

either that this crisis opened a path toward improvement of schools and education systems, and even reduction of the learning disparities described above. Most
importantly, the crisis accelerated the GIGA School Initiative policy initiative, as
mentioned earlier. By providing every student with one laptop or tablet, this initiative
is expected to close the gap in student access to online education. Local municipalities also offer students mobile Wi-Fi tools, which could be of great help to those
who have no internet equipment at home. This section aims to highlight three additional silver linings in this pandemic. Those include the transformation of teacher
professional culture, personalized learning through online education, and enhanced
communications between parents and children.
Teachers in Japan are well known for their high degree of professional identities
(Akita & Lewis, 2008). This pride as an educational professional does not necessarily
translate into the usage of ICT devices. According to TALIS in 2018, only 18% of
teachers answered that they use ICT “frequently” or “always” at the junior high school
level (OECD, 2020a). In some cases, it is even possible that this very professional
identity can inhibit teachers from relying on digital materials. Some teachers view
other teachings utilizing online materials made by others as a lack of effort, and these
teachers might try to create their own materials. Indeed, during the school closure, as
indicated by the MEXT survey, far less than half of the teachers used TV programs
(despite readily available content, such as NHK for School) or lecture videos provided
by the Board of Education (MEXT, 2020c). However, compared to the figure in
TALIS (18%), 36% of junior high school teachers reported using digital learning
materials during the closure. According to another survey of teachers in public
elementary and junior high schools conducted after the school closure (Benesse
Educational Research and Development Institute, 2021), even higher proportions of
teachers implemented ICT devices in classes after schools were reopened: 63.3%
in elementary schools and 58.9% in junior high schools (pp. 16–17). As the GIGA
school initiative is further promoted, and ICT environments are set up, teachers will
be able to fully tap into the opportunity to rely on diverse resources. By enhancing
this new practice, we argue, it could gradually transform the teacher culture in Japan.
Second, this crisis enabled Japan’s education system to provide more personalized
learning via online education. Japan has one of the highest number of children and
students per class among OECD countries. According to the OECD’s Education at
a Glance (OECD, 2020b), in 2018 the number of students per class in Japan was
27.2 compared to the OECD average of 21.1 in elementary schools. In the case of
junior high school, that number was 32.1 compared to the OECD average of 23.3.
The implementation of online classes and tutoring during the school closure allowed
students to ask teachers questions “in person,” and allowed teachers to give each
student more individualized attention.
Lastly, it is also important to highlight positive changes in the relationship between
children and parents. According to a survey conducted by the Cabinet Office, 70.3%
of married couples answered that time spent with family increased during the
pandemic (Cabinet Office, 2020). For those who experienced work from home, as
high as 77.7% reported that time spent with family increased (Cabinet Office, 2020).
As shown in an online survey conducted by the National Center for Child Health and

140

K. Iwabuchi et al.

Development, about 75% of children in the lower grades of elementary school (grade
1–3) needed parents’ help in home learning, and 60% of those in the upper grades
of elementary school (grade 4–6) needed parental help as well (National Center for
Child Health & Development, 2020). Hence, the increased time that parents spent
with their children, particularly for younger students, and their increased capacity to
assist their children, could improve learning at home.

5.5 Conclusion: Implications for Future Education
and Policy
In this chapter, we describe the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan
and illustrate government and school responses. Despite the uncertainty and anxiety
posed by the outbreak, the MEXT promptly announced policy initiatives and took
various supportive measures, most notably, the initiative to distribute personal ICT
devices to students. Schools, amidst the crisis, also took full responsibility for their
daily operations and strove to ensure student learning opportunities. Undoubtedly,
the crisis had persisting negative impacts on everyday learning, and exacerbated preexisting disparities among vulnerable populations, as well as among local governments. Aware of the enormity of the damage caused by this historic event, however,
we cannot stop offering, developing, or reimagining education.
As a concluding remark, we put forth key takeaways and postulate a way forward
out of the crisis. The first step is to reconsider the purpose of schools. Traditionally,
schools have served as the place for developing academic skills. The experiences of
the pandemic, however, highlight the need to understand the importance of schools
as the place for students’ mental growth, mental care, and mutual support through
communication and collaboration with friends and peers. Around 90% of teachers
reported that after the coronavirus outbreak, they came to see schools as a site for
learning with peers and socializing with others (Benesse Educational Research and
Development Institute, 2021). In fact, the National Center for Child Health and
Development has disclosed a survey result which shows that roughly 30% of high
school students reported symptoms of moderate depression during the pandemic
(National Center for Child Health & Development, 2021). In this context, it would
be imperative to rethink what the purposes and roles that schools play in education
and learning. In doing so, it is necessary to involve not only the community of
educational professionals, but also a more diverse groups of stakeholders, such as
parents, businesspeople, and the general public.
The next step is to reimagine forms, scales, and ways of cooperation among
schools and education systems. Given the policy initiatives allowing greater access
to online education, students can now learn in a variety of ways, in diverse locations, and with different peers, rather than just continuously commuting to the same
schools. The popularity of N High School symbolizes this shift in education and
people’s mindset. N High School is a correspondence high school that just opened in

5 Covid-19 and Education on the Front Lines in Japan: What Caused …

141

the spring of 2016. It has rapidly increased the number of entrants, reaching 20,000,
and its popularity has skyrocketed as it produced successful results related to university entrance. However, a closer look at this school reveals the popularity mainly
stems from the on-campus courses and programs, such as agricultural and fishing
experiences at the N Center (a local experiential learning center). In other words, it is
not sufficient to just emphasize the importance of online education. Rather, we need
to shift our focus onto the emergence of a new mode of learning that blends physical
(in-classroom) instruction and online education.
The recently revised Curriculum Guidelines (i.e., the national curriculum) in fact
resonates with this new form of education. It is characterized by active learning
and inquiry-based learning. Students can exercise these different types of learning
through online education at home, as well as real field experiences or site-based
inquiry (including intensive courses at camps). In doing so, students can freely choose
where, when, with whom (not just teachers, but practitioners; students of different
grades, ages, and from other regions), and what and how to learn. This means that
under these circumstances we can enhance more personalized learning. As stated
by Yoshimasa Hayashi, former Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and
Technology, it is imperative to transform the focus of education policy from formal
egalitarianism to fair individually optimized learning in public education (MEXT,
2018).
In this new setting, networks of schools can play a significant role and eventually
change the power dynamics of schools. In Japan, the rapid decline in birthrate has
led to the closure and merger of high schools and reduction of universities in rural
areas. By capitalizing on online education, however, those high schools in remote
areas, which would have to downsize or go under, could remain centers of learning.
If multiple centers are networked across regions, it will be possible to secure a certain
number of students and teachers, while offering a variety of programs in different
locations and potentially attract more students from wider areas. Field experiences
or experiential learning offered in these networks could serve as a hallmark that even
schools in urban areas might envy.
In order to achieve this goal, the current standards for establishing schools will
have to be reconsidered from all perspectives. At the same time, it is crucial to plan
how to evaluate and guarantee the quality of these new educational programs and of
the governance of educational institutions supplying those programs. Additionally,
we need to rethink ways in which the government is involved in education (such as
licensure, certification, supervision, and disbursement of subsidies) for schools and
students to exercise more agency.
Aside from policy initiatives to amend the problems mentioned above, the importance of capturing the impacts of the pandemic on students in more detail cannot be
overlooked. As reviewed in this chapter, there are attempts to document what kind
of education is available for students. Yet, we still need to directly measure how
this crisis has influenced student academic performance. The MEXT will conduct
a nationwide survey in May 2021. The result of this survey is expected to help us
analyze the effects of the pandemic even more thoroughly.

142

K. Iwabuchi et al.

COVID-19 presents unprecedented challenges to us. Whether we can take them
as opportunities to reform education depends on how we will fight back. If we never
stop developing our ingenuity and keep learning via trial and error, we believe this
pandemic will indeed lead to groundbreaking innovations that can add a new page
to the history of education in Japan and around the world.

COVID-19 and Post-pandemic
Educational Policies in Mexico. What is
at Stake?
Sergio Cárdenas, Dulce Lomelí, and Ignacio Ruelas

Abstract The Latin American region is experiencing an educational crisis due to
the COVID-19 pandemic since efforts to contain the outbreak will grow the deep
educational and economic gaps characterizing this region. During the pandemic,
Mexico’s central intervention to continue instructional activities in the basic education system was implementing distance education based on educational television.
As expected, this intervention raised different concerns on its effectiveness and how
different student populations will be affected. This chapter has four main goals: (a) to
describe and analyze educational gaps before the pandemic, identifying the central
educational policies implemented in previous decades; (b) to describe and analyze
educational policies implemented during the pandemic and how these may affect
students at risk; (c) to conduct a prospective analysis to identify potential effects of
the sanitary crisis in the administration of the education system in Mexico, and (d)
to identify the main policy lessons resulting from the Mexican government initial
response to the COVID-19 sanitary crisis.

6.1 Introduction
The Latin America and the Caribbean region is experiencing a humanitarian crisis
considered a perfect storm. Most of the efforts to contain the COVID-19 outbreak will
increase the deep educational and economic gaps characterizing this region, such as
those recently described in the Regional Report of the Global Education Monitoring
Report (UNESCO, 2020). Furthermore, educational achievements that took decades
to accomplish, mainly surrounding enrollment rates and intergenerational education
mobility, will have vanished in a couple of years (Lustig et al., 2020).
The COVID-19 pandemic will affect millions of students and their families for
years. According to preliminary information about how this virus was transmitted,
the required lockdown policies and the mandatory closure of nearly a quarter-million

schools across this country beginning on March 23rd, 2020, was a rational response
(Viner et al., 2020). However, due to the rapid transition to distance education, it
was challenging to design effective interventions to support students, parents, and
teachers during this period, resulting in an interruption of instructional activities for
a significant part of this country’s student population. This condition may explain
why nearly 46.5% of surveyed primary school teachers reported that “it was difficult
to guarantee a curriculum continuity” during this period (Juntos por el Aprendizaje,
2020).
During the pandemic, Mexico’s central intervention to continue instructional
activities in the basic education system has been implementing distance education
based on educational television, implemented through a public–private partnership
(Compañ García, 2020; Dietz & Cortés, 2020). However, different concerns arose
on the technological divide and whether educational television effectively supports
students already at risk before the pandemic (Baptista Lucio et al., 2020). Furthermore, almost a year after the mandatory school closures, it is still unknown how
students and teachers have used educational television across the country and whether
this instructional modality will result in differentiated learning loss, particularly
affecting disadvantaged students (Pozas et al., 2021). In addition, there are no clear
strategies for interventions addressing learning recovery when schools reopen after
the pandemic. Under these conditions, it is not easy to anticipate how school communities and teachers will support students and their families once lockdown policies
are lifted.
This chapter has four main goals: (a) to describe and analyze educational gaps
that existed in Mexico before the pandemic, identifying the central educational policies implemented in previous decades; (b) to describe and analyze educational policies implemented during the pandemic and how these may disproportionally affect
students at risk; (c) to conduct a prospective analysis to identify potential effects of
the sanitary crisis in the administration of the education system in Mexico; and (d)
to identify the main policy lessons resulting from the Mexican government response
to the COVID-19 sanitary crisis.

6.2 Conditions Before the Pandemic
The Mexican education system is organized into three levels: basic, upper secondary,
and tertiary education. The education system enrolls 36.5 million students, with 30.4
million in compulsory education (basic and upper secondary). It is largely publicly
funded: 89% of students and 85% of teachers attend and work in schools supported
by federal and local governments (SEP, 2020), and it is partially decentralized, with
nearly 81.9% of the public schools currently managed by 31 state governments (SEP,
2020) (Table 6.1).
In Mexico, just like in other Latin American countries, there is an unequal distribution of educational opportunities, affecting the neediest population. As the Regional
Report of the Global Education Monitoring Report 2020 (UNESCO, 2020) points

out, in Latin America, “the richest 20% are five times as likely as the poorest 20% to
complete upper secondary school, on average”. The digital divide, inadequate instructional practices, lack of support for teachers and principals, inadequate information
systems, low academic performance, and rigid—and sometimes outdated—national
curricula remind us how the fair distribution of educational quality is still a pending
issue in this region (Vegas & Petrow, 2007).
With more than 25 million students enrolled in basic education, 1.2 million
teachers, and 230,424 schools, the COVID-19 sanitary crisis created enormous challenges for educational leaders in Mexico by showing the unequal distribution of
educational quality across schools and regions (Lee & Koh, 2020; UNESCO, 2021).
Although in previous years there were positive trends (e.g., average years of
schooling increased from 8.1 years in 2005 to 9.6 years in 2019 while adult illiteracy rates decreased from 8.4% in 2005 to 3.8% in 2019) (INEE, 2019), significant inequalities remain in the Mexican education system (INEE, 2019), and will
increase due to school closures. These longstanding variations in available resources
and academic results across regions and populations in Mexico (OECD, 2019) interacted with some of the pandemic’s effects, affecting emergency education program
design.
There are several examples of the challenges faced before the pandemic. For
instance, the education gap index, measuring the size of the population without access
to compulsory education, shows that around 17% of the adult population included
does not have access to basic education (CONEVAL, 2019), and this population
group is mostly located in the country’s poorest regions (Fig. 6.1).
Dropout rates depicted another challenge the Mexican education system had to
address during the pandemic. The pre-COVID analysis estimated that for the 2020–
2021 school, yearly dropout rates would be 1.1% in primary school level, 5.3% in
secondary schools, and 15.2% in high school (INEE, 2019), under normal operating
conditions. Similar to other measurements, there are significant differences in this
indicator across regions (rural vs. urban) and associated with ethnicity, suggesting
additional challenges regarding the distribution of institutional capacities to support
students at risk across the country.
Data from the national school census (Formato 911) corresponding to the most
recent school year are not public. However, the Ministry of Education estimated
a dropout rate of around 10% for basic education due to the pandemic in 2020,
representing nearly 2.5 million students out of school (SEP, press briefing, August
8th, 2020). This figure highlights some of the future challenges for educational

authorities regarding the population’s size that will require flexible pathways for
students to graduate from compulsory education.
Student academic achievement is a final factor in the estimation of gaps or inequalities across populations and regions. Regarding international assessments, published
results point out significant academic performance gaps. Mexico reports “the highest
share of students among OECD countries” in performance level two, considered “the
minimum level to function in today’s societies” (OECD, 2019).
National evaluations present a similar trend. For instance, the National Plan
for Learning Evaluation (PLANEA) is a national test administered in Mexican
schools. The most recent secondary education results (2017) showed that, nearly
33.8% of assessed students in language performed at the lowest measured level from
the national sample. However, when this analysis focused on students from rural
schools, about 60% performed at the lowest level. Significant gaps were also reported
on family income, ethnicity, rurality, poverty, and parents’ educational attainment.
Finally, according to PISA results (2018), only 1% of Mexican students achieved the
top performance level in at least one area, while 35% did not achieve a minimum
level of performance.
Evidence suggests that student dropout is explained by different social and
economic factors, like living in rural areas, parents’ educational attainment, current
employment situation, and learning disabilities (Gibbs & Heaton, 2014). For instance,
Campos-Vazquez and Santillan (Campos-Vazquez & Santillan, 2018) found that the
lack of a secondary school located in a rural locality increases the probability of
dropping out by 6.8%. In addition to this, more recent evidence suggests that the
probability of completing upper secondary education is associated with socioeconomic and demographic factors, characteristics of educational institutions students
attend, and previous educational experiences (Mendoza Cazarez, 2019).
These conditions are relevant since estimations suggest the population living
below the national poverty line will increase to 9.8 million after the pandemic,
compared to the previous estimate from 2018. Therefore, the percentage of people
living in poverty will increase from 48.8% to 56%, or 56.7% after the pandemic
(CONEVAL, 2020). Since available data shows that between 5 and 17% of children

between 5 and 14 years old do not attend school due to lack of financial resources,
increasing the population living in poverty will result in additional educational gaps
and inequalities to be addressed by post-COVID educational policies.

6.3 National and Local Government Responses
to the COVID-19 Pandemic
In January 2020, the first news about COVID-19 began to circulate in Mexico.
However, it was not until March 14th when national health and education authorities determined schools should be closed for two weeks starting on March 23rd
to decrease the transmission of COVID-19 (SEP, 2020). After this initial period
of school closure, the Mexican government decided to extend it for two additional
weeks, corresponding to the spring break. When this extension was informed, educational authorities still anticipated instructional activities would resume on April
20th.
The initial reaction defined how local education agencies dealt with the mandatory school closure. There was limited access to information, resulting in a short
preparation period for school communities since there was an expectation to return
to regular instructional activities promptly. Also, 11 out of the 32 states decided to
implement school closures one week earlier than the original deadline recommended
by the federal government, closing on March 16th. This decision represented even
fewer days for preparation among school communities.
The lockdown finally occurred at the beginning of the second half of the school
year. A return to regular instructional activities was announced and postponed several
times. In early April, the Ministry of Education reported instructional activities would
resume remotely. However, this decision resulted in a steep learning curve for teachers
and educational authorities, who had to redesign instructional activities rapidly. Since
the pandemic continued its course and the cases of COVID-19 continued to rise,
Mexican authorities decided to continue the rest of the school year remotely and
later, to start the 2020–2021 school year in a distance mode. This condition would
remain for the rest of the school year.

6.3.1 Main Strategies
On April 20th, the Mexican government implemented a recently designed intervention, “Learning at Home”. This initiative was the primary strategy to support students
during the health crisis. It was implemented by broadcasting and distributing educational programs through TV, internet, and radio, scheduling broadcast classes for

158

S. Cárdenas et al.

primary and lower secondary grades. This strategy was based on educational television since 92.5% of Mexican families report having a TV set (76.5% digital),
(ENDUTIH) (INEGI, 2019).
The organization and implementation of this program were straightforward. There
were different broadcast schedules reserved for each school grade. Each section
lasted between 1 and 3 h, depending on the school grade. Different subjects were
explained in each section, averaging about 30 min each. TV programs were broadcast on different channels and repeated three times a day, so students had several
opportunities to watch them at different times based on what worked best for them
or their families, or even to watch different sections to reinforce their learning.
The content corresponded to the official national curriculum, and it was supported
by a set of free textbooks distributed to each student at the beginning of the school
year. In addition to the TV programs, the course content was published on a website to
help teachers prepare and support students. Although this content was not delivered
on time in the early stages of the pandemic, affecting teachers’ activities, the operation
of this website later improved. Also, all programs became available on-demand on
SEP’s YouTube channel.
In addition to the design and distribution of educational materials, it was expected
that teachers would keep in contact with students through phone calls, text messaging,
video calls, and digital platforms. Teachers would assign homework and other
learning activities and receive evidence of activities conducted at home. In the early
stages of this program, teachers even had to submit a digital portfolio of educational
experiences as proof of their work. Education authorities also organized professional
development activities to support teachers in developing digital skills.
Although these actions were designed to reach most students, part of the population did not have access to television or the Internet since TV stations would cover
only 70% of the national territory. Additionally, access to the Internet was only available to nearly 50% of households, systematically excluding student populations due
to the digital divide and the emergency curriculum design (Amador Bautista, 2020).
For these populations, the Ministry of Education considered delivering printed workbooks and broadcast content from this initiative through radio programs, addressing
similar topics to those presented on TV, but with some variations. For the review
conducted for this chapter, we were able to confirm that these programs considered
primary-school level course content. The schedule for radio programs consisted of
one hour every day for each grade, with 30 min allocated to a specific subject taught
in each grade and the rest of the time allocated to teach a subject shared with a
different school grade. Teachers also had to visit communities to distribute printed
materials and provide feedback to students if possible.
In addition to the content designed for primary and secondary education, the
Ministry of Education designed instructional materials for early childhood. In these
cases, the Ministry designed programs as daily 30-min segments, addressing socioemotional education, parenting practices, playing activities, and creativity development. A critical issue in implementing the “Learning at Home” program is the
decrease in expected instructional time. Some studies point out a slight adaptation

Adapted from SEP (2017) and the description of the Learning at
Home Program

of the national curriculum, resulting in inadequate instructional practices (Ducoing,
2020).
The following Table 6.2 illustrates a significant decrease in instructional time
reported for every educational level. By design, the Learning at Home TV or radio
programs’ instructional time would only be part of the students’ daily learning activities since teachers would assign additional tasks. However, some studies found that
nearly 30% of teachers were not in contact with their students (Baptista Lucio et al.,
2020). Other studies suggest that up to 80% of students did not have access to technology (Magallanes Ulloa & Ávila González, 2020). Therefore, since teachers could
not guide or support all students, the instructional time decreased, mainly affecting
disadvantaged students.
Besides the Learning at Home program, the federal government promoted other
interventions during the pandemic, including some already implemented before the
lockdown. The “MexicoX” platform, where massive open online courses are available for free, is one example. This platform started in 2015, delivering courses aimed
to support teacher professional development activities. During the pandemic, its
academic contents were adapted to respond to school communities’ needs, particularly for remote work and distance education, providing courses on risk prevention
at school, cyberbullying, information literacy, and the use of virtual labs. Another
initiative adapted to respond to the pandemic conditions was “aprende.mx”. This
program aims to develop digital and ICT skills among basic education teachers and
students, establishing alliances with other programs and agencies such as Educational
Television. Its main goal was to provide online training on digital skills, Microsoft
Office 365 applications, lesson planning, educational technology, webinars, digital
literacy, digital citizenship, and educational use of digital resources.
Besides the initiatives adopted by the Ministry of Education, other interventions
were designed by federal education agencies, like the National Commission for
Education Improvement (MEJOREDU). This agency designed and implemented five
professional development workshops to support teachers, school principals, supervisors, and pedagogical advisers. These courses were designed to be distributed online
in an editable digital format. The main topics were how to adapt instructional practices, exert leadership, and implement supervision strategies during the pandemic
(Comisión Nacional para la Mejora Continua de la Educación, 2020).

6.3.2 Technological Platforms
An important aspect to understand the Mexican education agencies’ response during
the pandemic is to analyze how technology platforms designed by Google for
Education and Microsoft were used. Agreements signed with Google for Education allowed access to a dedicated website, more than 16 million email accounts
for basic-level educational actors, organization of professional development activities through webinars, and distributing digital educational materials aligned with the
official curriculum (SEP, 2020). The agreement signed with Microsoft granted access
to the Mexican government to accounts and digital tools for distance education and
online training (SEP, 2020). Due to these agreements, teachers had access to alternatives to implement distance education. Also, local education agencies across the
country had access to these platforms to complement the Learning at Home program.
These platforms were part of the central policy to provide support and feedback
directly to students and gather evidence to facilitate learning evaluation. However,
it is essential to remember the limitations regarding connectivity: according to a
national survey administered by the Mexican government, only 56.4% of Mexican
families have access to internet services, and 44.3% of families have a personal
computer at home (INEGI, 2019).

6.3.3 Local Government Responses
An essential characteristic of the Mexican education system is its decentralized operation. Although with some legal limitations, state governments design and implement different local initiatives to support students. A review of different efforts
implemented to complement the Ministry of Education’s national strategy during
the pandemic highlights different initiatives, mainly related to professional development activities, connectivity, and support to families and parents. Table 6.3 describes
some of these interventions.
Despite the significant challenges the pandemic created and the difficulties it
represented for all the actors involved in education, there are valuable experiences
from which we can learn and effective practices to be considered for long-term implementation. For instance, the rapid digitalization process of instructional activities and
the skills developed by teachers and students necessary to implement the “Learning
at Home” program allowed them to interact virtually. It opened doors to diversify
instructional practices, as some surveys administered to teachers across the country
suggest (Baptista Lucio et al., 2020). Experiences of better coordination and collaboration across different educational communities have also been reported, such as
the adaptation of the “Proyecto Medición Independiente de Aprendizajes” (MIA), a
model designed to adapt the curriculum to students’ individual conditions (Hevia,
2020). Besides, teachers’ creativity, commitment, and efforts to provide a solution
to distance work are noticeable, especially in communities without access to the

learned from these experiences: documentation, systematization, and dissemination
work conducted by education authorities could convert a crisis into a learning experience for the entire education system, particularly to inform innovations aimed to
support disadvantaged populations.

6.4 What Do We Know About the Effects of the Pandemic
in Mexico?
There is preliminary data on the effects of the different programs implemented during
the pandemic. For instance, MEJOREDU, a public agency coordinating the National
System for the Continuous Improvement of Education (Comisión Nacional para la
Mejora Continua de la Educación, 2020), administered a survey to teachers, principals, students, and families in June 2020. Nearly 194,000 persons from all over
the country responded to their electronic survey, with almost 15,035 school principals (5,442 from pre-school, 5,426 from elementary school and 4167 from middle
school); 71,419 teachers (20,025 in preschool, 27,624 in elementary school and
23,770 in middle school); 72,305 parents (19,711 in preschool, 31,535 in elementary
school and 21,059 in middle school), and 34,990 students (10,299 elementary school
and 24,691 middle school). The survey sample design was not probabilistic due to

162

S. Cárdenas et al.

the public health restrictions, although the response rate was high. The information collected allows us to describe experiences and perceptions regarding instructional activities during the lockdown. The main results for teachers and students are
described as follows.
Teachers:
• 75.4% of teachers designed their own instructional activities and resources
(YouTube channels, groups on social networks, blogs, worksheets), in addition to
Learning at Home offerings.
• According to 69.8% of the teachers, parents were not able to provide support to
students.
• 51.4% of teachers consider online activities, television, and radio programs to be
boring.
• Content of the Learning at Home program was not enough to facilitate students
to continue learning, according to 46.3% of the teachers surveyed.
• The main technological tools available for teachers were cell phones with internet
access (87.2%), home computers (73.9%), television (58.3%), with lower access
to TV programs in highly marginalized municipalities (39%).
• Regarding professional development activities to support the implementation of
distance education, only 56.2% of teachers acknowledged receiving adequate
support.
• Providing adequate feedback for students was one of the main challenges,
according to 57.4% of the surveyed teachers.
• Teachers reported an increase of more than 50% in their telephone, internet, and
electricity bills.
This information confirmed that teachers faced considerable challenges to
continue instructional activities during the early stages of the pandemic. Additionally, it points out how technology and family resources were not equally available or
distributed, increasing pressure on teachers to support students lacking resources or
support from their families.
Students:
• Communication between students and teachers has been mainly through
messaging apps or telephone calls: WhatsApp (58.3%), telephone calls (41.5%),
video calls (24.5%), and email (27.3%).
• 94.5% of primary school and 69.7% of secondary school students required support
from their mothers, fathers, or caregivers.
• Not every student had access to the benefits of the “Learning at Home” program.
61.9% reported they received materials and resources from the school, while only
56.7% stated they frequently used the Learning at Home resources.
• Around half of students relied on digital platforms: 65.5% always or regularly used
the Google for Education platform, but only 45.3% used the online resources of
Learning at Home.

6 COVID-19 and Post-pandemic Educational Policies in Mexico …

• Students reported that the main problems they experienced were the lack of support
from teachers, a lack of clarity in their instructional activities, and the limited
feedback on their academic activities.
• More than 60% of the surveyed students reported having enough physical space to
do their homework. However, only 37% in primary school and 49% in secondary
school had access to a computer for instructional activities at home.
This information confirms the difficulties faced by school communities, pointing
out the limitations of this distance education model and the unequal availability of
resources across students.
In addition to the survey administered by MEJOREDU, universities and civil
society groups also collected data. For instance, Juntos por el Aprendizaje1 (2020)
and the School of Government and Public Transformation of the ITESM (2020) are
two examples of available data to analyze how the education system operated during
the health crisis. Although none of the surveys represent the educational system
as a whole, their results allow for comparing information and guiding potential
interventions to address the most pressing issues.
Juntos por el Aprendizaje found that parents, teachers, principals, and supervisors
reported similar conditions regarding schoolwork perceptions during the lockdown.
The strategies teachers and students found most helpful were distributing digital
resources, using portfolios, and providing individual tutoring for students. The most
used platforms were Zoom, WhatsApp, and Google Meet.
Almost all of the surveyed students reported having internet access, and all
reported having at least one device to access digital content. Also, communication between parents and teachers increased. In contrast, communication between
principals and parents decreased. More than 70% of school principals and teachers
agreed they had digital skills to search for information on the internet and create
and distribute instructional material. However, all considered, they needed support
to facilitate students’ school activities, mainly in technology and socio-emotional
fields. Regarding challenges, more than half of the surveyed school principals and
teachers reported feeling more stressed than before. The most significant challenges
perceived by students are those related to socio-emotional and learning aspects;
in the case of teachers, there are administrative and technological obstacles that
continuously add pressure.
Similarly, the School of Government and Public Transformation of the ITESM
(2020) administered another survey, focused on collecting parents’ perceptions,
specifically about the “Learning at Home” program. This study was conducted during
October 2020, 7 months after the school closures, and it was administered to 500
parents whose children attend public schools. Among the main findings is that 70% of
1 Juntos por el Aprendizaje is an initiative supported by different educational independent groups.
They conducted the survey “Education during the COVID-19 contingency” (Juntos por el Aprendizaje, 2020) during May and June 2020, that is, three months after the closing of the schools
and the start of remote schoolwork. This survey was administered to parents, teachers, principals,
and supervisors (65% public schools and 35% from private schools), for a total sample of 7,114
respondents.

164

parents considered that the lack of face-to-face instructional activities affected their
children emotionally. More than half of parents surveyed detected anger, anxiety, and
sadness in their children. 90% of surveyed parents had access to a television device
or a cell phone, and 70% had access to the internet. However, parents reported that
their children do not like or are not interested in the televised lessons. Also, 80% of
surveyed parents considered televised classes to be less effective than face-to-face
lessons. In comparison 62% expressed the need to get better support from teachers
since parents addressed most of the questions raised by students about classes and
homework in this period. 75% maintained contact with school staff, but only 16%
reported they had observed good feedback from teachers. Among some worrying
aspects, three stand out: their children are not interested in continuing their studies, the
students’ difficulty concentrating increased, and parents observed reduced initiative
on behalf of students to study without teacher support (Fernández et al., 2020).
Other studies pointed out additional perceived effects among students. For
instance, in a study conducted in a Mexican state, 21.3% of surveyed students considered that their learning experiences were affected due to the COVID-19 crisis. In
comparison, 47.3% believe finding a job will be more challenging when they finish
their studies.
Recently, the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI, 2021) administered a Survey to Measure the Impact of COVID-19 on Education (Encuesta para
la Medición del Impacto COVID-19 en la Educación). Among the findings, it is
worth noting that 738,394 students did not complete the 2019–2020 school year; the
percentage of male students who dropped out (2.1% in public schools and 5.5% in
private) is slightly higher compared to female students (1.9% in public schools and
2.8% in private). 58.9% of these students dropped out due to reasons associated with
the pandemic, including loss of contact with their teachers, decrease in household
income, permanent school closure, or because they lacked access to the internet and
technological devices. The remaining 41.1% of students mentioned other reasons,
such as the need to find a job and the lack of funding. This report also highlights that
around 5.2 million students did not enroll in the 2020–2021 school year. 44.2% of
students reported not enrolling due to COVID-19, and 55.8% did not enroll because
of a lack of financial resources. The survey pointed out that the percentage of male
students who did not enroll (10.1%) is slightly higher than that female students
(9.1%). It is worth noting that out of the 5.2 million students who did not enroll in
the current school year, 2.9 million (57%) belong within the basic education level
(Table 6.4).
Regarding those who did not enroll in the 2020–2021 school year due to COVID19, 26.6% of students expressed that classes held on a distance model were not
functional, 25.3% did not enroll because their parents were unemployed, and 21.9%
did not enroll because of a lack of technological devices or access to the Internet.
It is important to note that out of the 32.9 million students enrolled in the 2020–
2021 school year, 30.3% indicated that they had not received support from a member
of the household with their schoolwork; this situation is worse at the secondary level,
where 48.3% of the students reported not receiving support. Finally, a significant

Despite differences across the surveys regarding the sample and timing, collected
data provides a panoramic vision of the educational system’s situation around the
public health crisis. The recurring challenges are supporting students and teachers
regarding socio-emotional aspects and technology use, both in terms of access and
teacher professional development. Any intervention in these areas needs to go beyond
technical aspects like hardware and focus on a pedagogical approach for a more
motivating and practical use. It is essential to understand that none of the surveys
presented focuses specifically on the most vulnerable population, particularly those

located in rural contexts without access to the technology through which these surveys
were administered. By the end of the 2020–2021 school year, a detailed diagnosis
of student and teacher performance is yet to be reported. Also, the publication of
information about enrollment and dropout rates is still pending, and there is a need
to administer representative surveys to assess different populations’ conditions. This
information will be valuable to design policies and interventions to mitigate the
negative impacts of school closures in the years following the pandemic.

6.5 What Do We Know About Potential Interventions?
We still know very little about the actual magnitude of the effects the COVID-19
crisis will ultimately have in Mexico. Initial global estimates identify potential significant losses in academic achievement (Azevedo et al., 2020a) and personal income
(Psacharopoulos et al., 2020). Other studies describe potential adverse effects in
dropout rates, concluding that more than 9 million students may permanently be out of
school, nearly 40% of them from low-income families (Acevedo et al., 2020). These
estimates point out the importance of implementing timely and effective government
interventions. Furthermore, it reminds us about the relevance of adopting a “Building
Back Better” approach once schools reopen. Adopting this approach would mean
prioritizing the most vulnerable populations and promoting a redesign of public
institutions to avoid the reproduction and continuity of unfair educational inequalities that characterized educational systems before and during the pandemic. The
effectiveness of national government interventions to address the negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic depends directly on the availability of robust
scientific evidence regarding causes and corresponding interventions. Despite some
limitations, available research highlights the leading causes explaining some of the
inequalities associated with the COVID-19 crisis, like the digital divide, differences
in the cultural capital across families, inadequate learning environments at home,
mental health issues, unemployment, lack of educational materials, nutritional deficiencies, and the low quality of available distance education programs (Acevedo

et al., 2020; Akmal et al., 2020; Aristovnik et al., 2020; Asanov et al., 2020a; Dorn
et al., 2020; Grewenig et al., 2020; Hanushek & Woessmann, 2020; Lopez Boo et al.,
2017; Lustig et al., 2020; UNESCO, UNICEF, & The World Bank, 2020).
Identification and analysis of these causes will help evaluate the feasibility and
potential effects of educational interventions. Available research identifies different
interventions, like promoting collaboration across education and public health
agencies, implementing programs to specifically reduce dropout rates, designing
summer learning programs, providing free access to the Internet, and modifying
grading criteria. Other suggested interventions include organizing workshops to teach
students how to use distance learning platforms, supporting students and families
in creating and improving learning environments at home, distribution of scholarships and conditional cash transfer programs, nutrition programs, and psychological support. Regardless of the combination of interventions, it is essential to
emphasize that learning recovery programs must be prioritized (Acevedo et al.,
2020; Akmal et al., 2020; Aristovnik et al., 2020; Asanov et al., 2020a, b; Dorn
et al., 2020; Grewenig et al., 2020; Hanushek & Woessmann, 2020; Lopez Boo
et al., 2017; Lustig et al., 2020; Marinoni et al., 2020; Reimers & Schleicher, 2020;
Sanchez et al., 2020). As expected, these recommendations provide some insights
regarding different options governments have to address educational inequalities in
a post-pandemic period.

6.5.1 Policy Options
As pointed out, several restrictions limit the evaluation of currently implemented
programs, and therefore the identification of preliminary results. Most of the available research is still descriptive, with limited access to program evaluations. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, no official estimation of current dropout rates
has been published. These conditions limit the potential use of evidence to support
different policy options. Therefore, some options suggested are mainly based on
assumptions resulting from comparative analysis or broad international recommendations. However, it is necessary to understand the context and collect new evidence
to better explain how the education system will respond to challenges resulting from
school closures. The following activities are supported by available studies as an
incremental approach to be explored considering there is still limited information on
potential educational policies to be implemented in a post-COVID recovery period.
(a)

Improve information collected

The described conditions anticipate challenging contexts for school communities.
The interaction between old and new educational inequalities will result in a complex
context to design recovery policies. The reviewed interventions represent different
approaches, whose effectiveness in Mexico’s case might be difficult to evaluate since
there is limited data about current enrollment, dropout rates, and the effectiveness of
the different policies implemented during the public health crisis. An essential initial

168

S. Cárdenas et al.

activity is to assess the conditions currently observed in the education system in
this context. Collecting reliable and updated information is necessary to understand
key aspects, like how teachers interacted with students, or how school communities
supported teachers and school principals. Data from three sources will be needed
in the first stage: schools, families, and students who abandoned formal education
programs. The following Table 6.6 describes specific information needs to conduct
a preliminary diagnostic.
Collecting reliable data is a priority since currently available information is not
nationally representative in several cases, and there is a limited analysis regarding
current students’ and teachers’ conditions. Furthermore, there is limited analysis and
information about the type of instructional practices implemented, how students were
taught or monitored, as well as how teachers may address learning loss problems
once schools reopen.
(b)

Learning recovery programs

The information collected suggests a significant part of the student population
in Mexico has experienced substantial challenges to continue learning during the
pandemic. As available data points out, the distribution of students across academic
performance levels in national tests administered before the pandemic demonstrates
that a significant percentage of the population did not achieve adequate academic
performance before the interruption of classes. Given the expected differentiated
effects on student performance, the design and implementation of learning recovery
programs will be required.

An essential aspect is the capacity to identify non-traditional venues to provide
additional learning opportunities to disadvantaged students. An effective intervention will require exploring interventions like modified curriculums, diversification
of instructional materials and activities, extended school days or years, education
technology (repositories and digitalized materials), afterschool activities, intensive
summer learning programs, hiring specialized teachers to accelerate learning, and
most importantly, the adoption of these initiatives in nearly every school in the
country.
To implement learning recovery programs, the participation of parents will be
essential in the post-pandemic stage. As the different surveys pointed out, parents’
roles in supporting students at home determined better learning experiences. Unfortunately, policies designed to promote parental involvement in Mexico have not been
effective (Flores-crespo & Ramírez Ramón, 2015; Martin & Flores, 2015).
Regardless of the limited parental involvement observed before the pandemic,
its associated positive effects with academic performance (Martínez Rizo, 2004)
suggest promoting their involvement will be an effective strategy to complement
instructional activities at schools. Since learning recovery requires exploring any
venue outside of schools, defining new policies to encourage parental involvement
will be necessary to diversify interventions and increase school effectiveness to
support disadvantaged students.
(c)

Adopting a lifelong learning approach

Lifelong learning policies create learning opportunities “rooted in the integration
of learning and living, covering learning activities for people of all ages (children,
young people, adults and the elderly, girls and boys, women and men), in all life-wide
contexts (family, school, community centers, museums, workplaces) and through a
variety of modalities (formal, non-formal, and informal)” (UIL, n.d.). Adopting flexible approaches to create multiple learning opportunities inside and outside schools
will be necessary during the recovery process. Considering these characteristics,
adoption of this approach may result in (a) increasing and diversifying the number
of stakeholders involved in the reorganization of education systems; and (b) creating
“safety networks” to support drop-out students by promoting flexible learning pathways and reorganizing non-formal school options. Adopting this approach may result
in different benefits, including the collaboration of local authorities, the diversification of learning delivery methods, and increased participation and funding to support
recovery programs.
(d)

Increased funding

As pointed out in different reports on post-COVID 19 educational policies, implementing recovery programs will increase the pressure to increase and improve educational spending. In Mexico, educational spending equals 6.1% of the GDP, with
nearly one-third allocated to basic education. A problem to be considered for the
post-COVID period is that nearly 98% of current educational spending is allocated
to salaries, making it challenging to fund additional recovery programs, like extended
school days, after-school activities, or summer programs.

Based on the only officially published dropout rate for basic education during
the lockdown, estimated at 10% (representing about 2.5 million students), creating
out-of-school learning opportunities to obtain a basic education diploma will require
investing nearly 344 million US dollars. Likewise, based on the number of students
who were not enrolled in basic education in the 2020–2021 school year (INEGI,
2021), creating out-of-school learning opportunities would require nearly 406 million
US dollars. These estimations are obtained based on current spending on adult education programs. Furthermore, the worst-case scenario described in Table 6.7 would
mean investing 665.1 million dollars, increaseing by sixfold the current federal
budget allocated to INEA, the National Adult Education Agency (Fig. 6.3).

As in previous recommendations, these estimations may help to identify some of
the potential challenges to be addressed in a Post-COVID period. A more detailed
estimation will require identifying strategies to be explored in the near future, in
addition to better identifying target populations.

6.6 Final Comments
Beyond the ideal selection and implementation of specific interventions or programs
supported by evidence, there are three key aspects to be considered by decisionmakers during the design of education recovery plans in Mexico. First, it is necessary
to raise awareness among national actors and stakeholders about the magnitude and
seriousness of the post-COVID education crisis. Raising awareness is crucial since
that may help to increase the public education budget. Furthermore, it is necessary to
effectively communicate that any effort to address educational inequalities associated
with the COVID-19 crisis will require a long-term commitment, considering periods
of at least nine or ten years.
The second aspect is that a policy window is now open to promote significant
transformations on how education systems in the region must be organized. This
situation opens an opportunity to diversify delivery methods (mainly through digitalization) and promote the adoption of lifelong learning policies since non-formal
and informal education programs might become effective routes to develop skills
among disadvantaged populations, including those who drop out from formal education programs. It can also help engage new educational actors (like local governments,
community centers, or museums) and promote flexible and diverse learning opportunities. In other words, the design of educational policies in a post-pandemic period
may result in an opportunity to organize strategies to create all kinds of learning
opportunities - formal, non-formal, and informal. Finally, implementing an education recovery plan may inadvertently create new inequalities or deepen inequalities
resulting from previous decisions, contexts, or policies. Reducing unfair conditions
must be a permanent guiding principle while defining any intervention or recovery
plan’s characteristics.
The COVID-19 pandemic brought new and unpredictable challenges to education systems. However, almost 12 months after the school closures, it is necessary to understand better the harmful effects of the COVID contention measures
in Mexico, the characteristics of the exacerbated educational inequalities, and how
school communities may respond to these challenges. Furthermore, it is essential to
design potential interventions considering the pandemic’s long-term effects, avoiding
a simplistic perspective where the simple reopening of schools (a “business as usual
approach”) will be the main–and only–immediate policy goal.

Homeschooling in Norway During
the Pandemic-Digital Learning
with Unequal Access to Qualiﬁed Help
at Home and Unequal Learning
Opportunities Provided by the School
Marte Blikstad-Balas, Astrid Roe, Cecilie Pedersen Dalland,
and Kirsti Klette
Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has forced an unprecedented global shutdown
that has greatly changed what it means to be a teacher, a student, and even a parent
in the months that schools have been closed. While most school systems normally
require daily physical attendance and bring students together in large groups to learn
in a collective endeavor, the closing of schools and the months of social distancing
have shifted the site of learning to the home, where learning happens primarily alone
or with the help of family members through the technologies available. In this chapter,
we report on how school shutdown has affected the students in Grades 1–10 across
Norway, where teachers in March 2020 were asked to perform all their teaching
from home, through digital devices and remote teaching. As in other countries,
Norwegian teachers and school leaders were not prepared to go digital overnight,
despite good technological infrastructure and a curriculum that explicitly emphasizes
the importance of digital competence across subjects. Drawing on a national survey
administered to parents (N = 4,642) about how digital homeschooling was organized,
we have investigated what kind of educational opportunities students were offered
during the period of remote teaching. Our key findings are that digital home schooling
to a large degree consisted of students doing individual tasks, with limited support
from their teachers, especially in the lowest grades. We discuss how the unequal
access to qualified help at home challenges some of the core ideals of the Nordic
model of education—where equal opportunities to learn is a key ambition.

7.1 Introduction
In this chapter, we will investigate how the Norwegian government responded to
the international COVID-19 outbreak and discuss what measures were taken to
ensure equal learning opportunities for all students regardless of socioeconomic
background—something that is a key tenet of the Nordic Model of education (Klette,
2018). The Norwegian authorities announced the first cases of confirmed coronavirus
in Norway on February 27, 2020, stating that they were closely monitoring the situation. By March 13, several restrictions in all areas of society were implemented,
aiming to suppress the virus and keep the Pandemic under control. In addition to
strict social distancing rules limiting the number of people who could interact with
each other and the distance to be kept in all situations outside fixed “cohorts,” a major
change for most Norwegians was the restriction on where they could work or study.
Beginning on March 13, all educational institutions were closed, and all citizens were
encouraged to avoid any unnecessary use of public transportation and work from a
temporary home office if they were capable of doing so. The regulations presented
in March 2020 are considered the severest national regulations since Norway was
occupied during World War II.
All education normally happening in Norwegian daycare, kindergartens, schools,
and universities was suddenly replaced by so-called “homeschooling” or “remote
learning” in line with school closures in other countries.1 Around the world, leaders
expressed concern about the expected global learning losses resulting from the
Pandemic (Azevedo et al., 2020; Azevedo et al., chapter 16; Kuhfeld et al., 2020)
despite a general global consensus that education for all should still be prioritized even
with closed physical school buildings (Reimers, 2020). Another question of global
interest was what curriculum teachers should use during the Pandemic (Daniel, 2020)
and how schools could ensure equal learning opportunities to all students when all
students were sent home (Azevedo et al., chapter 16; OECD, 2018).
In Norway, unlike many other countries, the Pandemic did not cause a reprioritization of the national curriculum or new educational policies at the national level. All
Norwegian municipalities (“school owners”) are responsible for ensuring that their
school is managed in accordance with the Act relating to Primary and Secondary
Education (the Education Act, 1998). During the Pandemic, these municipalities
also became responsible for appropriate infection control measures (the Norwegian
Directorate of Health, 2020). The school owner is always obligated to ensure that all
students receive a formal education in accordance with both the National curriculum
and the Education Act, even if the schools are closed or have limited capacity (The
Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training, 2021b). Hence, the municipality
level should, as far as possible, follow the established subjects and teaching hour
distribution in periods when schools are closed or subject to other restrictions, and
they should only provide fewer teaching hours if they can justify why this is necessary. Overall, the teaching should provide an opportunity for the students to achieve

critical functions in society during the Pandemic (e.g., health services, transportation, infrastructure).

the competence aims in all subjects—and it should be emphasized that this expectation was not lowered during the Pandemic. In the case of students with specialized
needs, such as students who are entitled to special needs education or other forms
of personalized support, the temporary act passed in relation to COVID-19, allows
for the school owner to adjust in their education if it is necessary and justifiable
(Temporary Act on adaptations in the Kindergarten Act, the Education Act, and the
Free School Act to remedy consequences of outbreaks of COVID-19, 2020).

7.2 The Norwegian Context
As a backdrop for the Norwegian response to the Pandemic, we will provide some
key facts about the Norwegian school system and how it compares to other countries.
Since the end of World War II, equal opportunity for all has been a cornerstone of
the Nordic model for education—and the Nordic model is internationally known
to emphasize features that are critical for high quality education (Klette, 2018).
In Norway, all children have a legal right to 13 years of free education, starting
at age 6, and a vast majority of students (96%) attend public school rather than
private (Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training, 2020). Norway does not
allow private owners to make any profit from their educational activities. Further, the
establishment of a private school is only allowed if the school follows an alternative
pedagogy (e.g., Montessori schools) or if they are religious schools. The few private
schools in Norway still must follow the national curriculum (Klette, 2018).
The Norwegian compulsory school system is divided into two parts: primary
school (ages 6–13) and secondary school. Primary school consists of the lower
primary level (grades 1–4, ages 6–10), the intermediate level (grades 5–7, ages 10–
12), and lower secondary school (ages 13–16). The school year goes from August
to June. Students receive only formative feedback until grade 8, when they begin
receiving grades. As in the other Nordic countries, the school system is considered
a key approach to ensure a fair and equal society supporting democracy, participation, welfare, and life-long learning for all, regardless of their social, economic, and
geographical background (Klette, 2018).
Norwegian students are still performing at or above the OECD average in science,
reading, and mathematics as measured on the international PISA test. The PISA
results show little variation in test scores compared with other countries, indicating that Norwegian schools are “broadly able to offer an equitable education to
pupils from different backgrounds and that the vast majority of schools have pupils
performing at different proficiency levels” (Norwegian Directorate for Education and
Training, 2020, p. 35). While there is no country in the world that can claim to have
eliminated socio-economic inequalities in education, the egalitarian Scandinavian
countries have higher levels of social mobility than more unequal countries (OECD,
2018). Diversity in students’ ethnic backgrounds has changed in recent decades, and
18% of all students in compulsory education in 2019 had an immigrant background.

180

M. Blikstad-Balas et al.

These students generally do well in the Norwegian education system, although their
grades are slightly lower compared to other students (Norwegian Directorate for
Education and Training, 2020).
Teachers in Norway have great autonomy in deciding how to adapt the national
curriculum and teach their subjects, since the national curriculum is a framework
indicating overall thematic areas and goals (Mølstad & Karseth, 2016; Sivesind &
Wahlström, 2016) that leaves it up to each local school and teachers to decide when
and how to teach a specific content area and topic. This means that the teachers
and schools are supposed to make deliberate interpretations of the curriculum, such
as determining their pedagogical methods and deciding which resources (e.g., apps
and software) to include. Mausethagen & Møstad (2015) summarize Norwegian
teachers’ autonomy by pointing to three factors (1) pedagogical freedom and absence
of control; (2) the will and capacity to justify practices and (3) a local responsibility
(municipalities as school owners). As we will show, teacher autonomy becomes
particularly visible during homeschooling, as schools and teachers might interpret
and structure the homeschooling situation differently when it comes to required
attendance, checking in, and assignment requirements. Also, the lack of national
high stakes control such as teacher evaluation and national high stakes testing and
exit exams give a high degree of autonomy, but also responsibility (Hatch, 2013;
Hatch et al., 2020), to Norwegian teachers.
Teachers’ high autonomy became particularly visible during homeschooling.
While attendance at school was not suspended during the Pandemic, each school, and
even each teacher, decided how often students should participate (e.g., by logging
into Zoom or Teams at particular times or by handing in tasks by given deadlines).
Each school had autonomy to make all decisions about the organization of remote
schooling, and the only national decision was that all national final exams (normally
held in May) were cancelled for 2020 and 2021. The defined main mandate of teachers
in Norway to plan, deliver, and assess the learning of each student—and the class
as a whole (Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training, 2020)—was never
questioned during the Pandemic. However, the authorities made no national efforts to
support teachers in reaching all students digitally or to supplement the education of
marginalized students who need extra support. Further, no national measures were
in place to compensate for the discrepancy between the students who had access
to their parents at home during remote teaching and those who did not. This does
not mean that individual teachers were not following up their students, but it does
mean that there were no national guidelines or support to make sure such help was
consistent. When reading the other contributions of this book, it becomes evident
that compared to several other countries, Norway did very little on a national level
to ensure equality in education for all students during the time of school lockdown.

7.3 Pandemic Pedagogy: Digitally Mediated Learning
While some countries supported remote teaching through resources like books,
educational TV classrooms, and even radio (Miks & McIlwaine, 2020,
UNESCO/UNICEF/World Bank, 2020), the strong digital infrastructure in Norway
made it natural that all remote teaching should be digitally mediated education using
the digital platforms already established in schools. Norwegian educational policies
and national curricula have made digital competence an explicit aim for decades,
and teachers are supposed to draw on digital technology across grades and subjects
(Erstad, 2006; Wieberg Klausen, 2020). In the compulsory and secondary education reform of 2006, the Knowledge Promotion, five skills were defined as basic
to learning in school, work, and social life. These skills are basic in the sense that
they are considered fundamental to learning across all school subjects as well as
a prerequisite for students to show their competence and qualifications within and
across subjects. One of these skills are digital skills (The Norwegian Directorate
for Education and Training, 2012). Digital skills are defined as being able to use
different digital tools, media, and resources efficiently and responsibly, to solve
practical tasks, find and process information, design digital products and communicate content. Further, digital skills include developing digital judgment by acquiring
knowledge and good strategies for using the Internet (The Norwegian Directorate
for Education and Training). These skills should permeate all subjects and be used
when relevant, and it is up to each teacher to make all decisions on digital technology,
within the limitations of what hardware and software the school has made available.
One key prerequisite for success in school with going digital overnight is that
there is sufficient access to equipment and stable internet. Internet access at home
has repeatedly been measured at 98% of the population (e.g., Statistics Norway,
2020), and students’ overall access to technology has been significantly above the
European average measured by the student-per-laptop ratio (OECD, 2015). While
this great digital infrastructure may sound promising, previous research has revealed
that the uptake of technology varies greatly by classroom and that how technology
is used is largely dependent on individual teachers. Access to technology is not a
reliable predictor of teachers’ actual implementation of digital technology (BlikstadBalas & Klette, 2020; Elstad, 2016; Gil-Flores et al., 2017). The fact that each
teacher can decide to what degree and how they want to include digital technology
in their lessons will lead to unequal opportunities to develop digital competence.
Further, the latest Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) report from
Norway highlighted the discrepancy between merely providing access for students
and preparing teachers to utilize the technology in their everyday teaching (Throndsen
et al., 2019).
The few studies that have been published so far from Norway have shown that most
teachers were able to continue providing instruction for their students. Drawing on a
small-scale study following students, parents, and teachers in one municipality, Bubb
and Jones (2020) suggested that teachers adapted rapidly, and that homeschooling
was well received by students and their parents. Gudmundsdottir and Hathaway

182

M. Blikstad-Balas et al.

(2020) found that, despite teachers’ inexperience and unpreparedness for online
teaching, they were moderately prepared to use various digital tools and willing to
make online learning work for them and their students. In a national survey, teachers
and school leaders reported very limited prior experience with remote teaching,
but they also noted that they were able to teach their students from a distance and
to maintain contact with students and parents during the period of homeschooling
(Federici & Vika, 2020). At the same time, this national survey also showed that only
27% of teachers in primary and lower secondary school, and 23% of teachers in upper
secondary school, confirmed that they were able to follow up with vulnerable students
who needed special support during this period (Federici & Vika, 2020). There is
concern internationally that there will be less learning for most students during
the period of remote learning (Azevedo et al., 2020). One concrete manifestation
of this issue in Norway is the significant drop in writing competence in the first
grade, when comparing students who were remotely taught during the Pandemic
with students from previous years. Preliminary findings have indicated that, even
though the schools were closed for under two months, the estimated achievement
loss for first-grade students in writing was equivalent to one and a half semesters
(Skar, Graham, & Huebner, in review). Further, Mælan et al. (2021) survey on lower
secondary school, found that it was harder for low- achieving students to maintain
engagement and motivation during the period with home schooling compared to
regular school. They also found that students experienced less support from their
teachers, and summarize that there is reason to be concerned, especially for the low
achieving students, but also when it comes to the effects of home schooling in general
and the impact it may have on all students (Mælan et al., 2021). In the following
section, we will share analyses from a national survey where parents with children in
grades 1–10 were invited to share their experiences with remote learning. Drawing
from these experiences, we will discuss both the main challenges and some possible
benefits of homeschooling.

7.4 Parents’ Survey on Homeschooling
To shed light on the impact of the Pandemic on educational opportunities in Norway,
we developed an anonymous, digital survey about homeschool and remote teaching
for parents with students in primary and lower secondary schools. Due to the
crucial timing, we distributed the survey to parents digitally; specifically, we wanted
responses to reflect sentiment during the emerging and first period of homeschooling
and school lockdown, not in retrospect.
We invited parents with students in grades 1–10 from all over Norway to respond
to the survey. If the parents had several children in primary or lower secondary school,
they chose one of their children prior to starting the survey and answered all questions
for that child. The main ambition of the survey was to investigate all aspects of homeschooling, including what kind of remote teaching students were offered and how
parents experienced the homeschooling situation. The survey included background

7 Homeschooling in Norway During the Pandemic-Digital Learning …

183

questions about the school location, the student’s gender and grade, and the parent’s
level of education and work situation during the period (i.e., work outside home,
home office, laid off/unemployed, and stay-at-home parent). After completing the
background information, parents answered 24 questions directly related to the homeschool situation, such as digital equipment, attendance requirements, communication with teachers, tasks, subjects covered, students’ engagement and efforts toward
schoolwork, and the parent’s own experience during the period of homeschooling.
Due to the time sensitivity, we opted for a non-probability convenience sample
(Fowler, 2009) where we invited participation from invitations online, as with many
other one-time internet surveys. We recruited parents through selected social media
groups for parents on Facebook and Twitter. The teachers union and colleagues
from other universities in the field of education also helped us distribute the survey
through social media. As with any non-probability-based sample, the greatest limitations are the unknown relationship between the sample and the population and the
missing theoretical basis for estimating the repetitiveness of the sample. To compensate for some of these uncertainties, we included several background variables about
the respondents (e.g., where they lived and their educational background), which
enabled us to systematically monitor these variables in our samples and compare
them with nationally representative samples. In doing so, we were also able to evaluate responses as they came in to determine where we needed to put in extra effort
to obtain more responses; for example, if too many parents from the capital area
responded, we would systematically target parents in other areas.
The parent survey was answered by 4,642 parents from all over the country. A total
of 262 of the country’s 365 municipalities were represented with good geographical distribution including large and small towns as well as urban and rural areas.
Furthermore, 52% of the respondents represented students at the primary school level
(grades 1–4), 30% students at the intermediate level (grades 5–7), and 18% students at
the lower secondary level (grades 8–10), indicating that parents of younger children
were overrepresented in the sample. While 96% of all respondents had children in
public schools, only 4% were in private schools, which is the same percentage as for
the country (Statistics Norway [SSB], 2020). In terms of gender distribution, parents
reported about 54% boys and 46% girls. As a measure of socioeconomic status, we
asked parents about their highest level of education and compared their responses to
the national average for parents between 25 and 50 years, which we assume represents
most of the parents in our sample. Our sample had a higher percentage of parents
with a master’s degree or a Ph.D. and a lower percentage of parents with lower levels
of education (Statistics Norway, 2020). Despite not being a national representative
sample in terms of parents’ educational background and distribution of grade groups,
the data set we present here is, to the best of our knowledge, the most systematic and
most comprehensive available to examine how parents with children in grades 1–10
experienced the period of homeschooling and what characterized the instruction their
children took part in. The items we developed for this survey have also been included
in later and ongoing national evaluations of the period of homeschooling.
In the following, we will present the main findings from the survey, with an
emphasis on the impact of the Pandemic on educational opportunities for different

184

M. Blikstad-Balas et al.

groups of students and what kind of learning students were engaging in during the
period of homeschooling. We will also highlight what parents perceived as the most
challenging and most rewarding aspects of remote teaching before we discuss the
implications and potential lessons to be learned.

7.5 Analyses and Results
In the descriptive statistical analyses, we divided the students into the following three
groups: grades 1–4, grades 5–7, and grades 8–10, to show how the educational opportunities between these groups varied. We believe that most parents answering this
survey have good insight into what their child has been doing, particularly because
85.6% of the parents reported having been at home to a large degree during the period
of homeschooling. This finding is consistent with the high number of respondents
with higher education and jobs that typically can be done from the recommended
home office.
The open-ended questions in the survey were coded qualitatively using conventional content analyses (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005), where we identified and aggregated patterns in responses before selecting examples illustrating typical responses.
Two of the authors coded all the open-ended questions simultaneously and checked
for consistency in the coding during this process. Further, any borderline cases or
responses that were difficult to code were discussed before deciding on final coding.
We will start the analyses by reporting the parents responses regarding what
access to relevant technologies they had, what kinds of digital attendance schools
expected students to show and how much contact students had with their teachers
during the time of homeschooling. Then, we report on how parents and students
experienced remote learning, before looking into how parents themselves describe
the main challenges and benefits of homeschool education.
Access to equipment and prior knowledge about the schools’ digital systems
Access to equipment is a prerequisite for remote digital teaching, and we asked
parents to report what equipment students used for homeschooling. Several answers
were possible, and several parents reported up to three different devices. The results
are summarized in Fig. 7.1.
Figure 7.1 reveals a tendency for younger students to use their parents’ equipment,
while older students were more likely to have their own more equipment. Only 63%
of the parents with students in grades 1–4 reported using equipment provided by the
school, but 83% of lower secondary students reported using the schools’ equipment.
Figure 7.1 also shows that half of the students in lower secondary school and a third
of the students in grades 5–7 used a personal cellphone for schoolwork. While many
chose to use equipment other than that provided by the school, hardly any parents
complained about the quality of the equipment provided by the schools in the openended questions in the surveys. When asked if the equipment from school “worked

sufficiently well,” 96% of the 3171 parents who answered the question, confirmed
that it did, while 4% answered no.
Parents were asked to list the main software used by the schools for managing
remote teaching. We identified a clear trend that Microsoft Teams and Google Classrooms were used the most in lower secondary and in grades 5–7, while Showbie was
the most used learning system for grades 1–4. When asked how familiar the students
were with the schools’ chosen platform, only 48% of the parents reported that the
platform was well known before the Pandemic. In contrast, 23% reported that it was
known to some extent, while over a quarter of the parents (27%) reported that the
students were not familiar with the platform, and 2% were not certain. Again, the
tendency was that parents who had children in the lower grades reported the least
prior knowledge on how to use the school’s platform.
Attendance requirements and teaching practices
An important pedagogical question is how teachers can follow up with their students
to make sure they are participating when they are not physically present in the same
room. When both students and teachers are in their own homes, the everyday contact
in the classroom is replaced by other forms of contact, either by the teachers or the
students themselves. We asked parents to report on what was expected of the students
regarding attendance during a normal day of homeschooling.
As Fig. 7.2 shows, three-fourths of students in lower secondary school and twothirds of students in grades 5–7 were asked to be present at a given time each morning.
This finding is in stark contrast to the one third of students in grades 1–4 who had
to be present in the morning. We can also see that 23% of the parents with students
in grades 1–4 reported that their children were not expected to attend online classes

at all. Further, 27% of the parents of children in grades 1–4 reported that all their
child had to do to show that they were participating was to complete different tasks
with a given deadline. In the open-ended questions, where parents could describe key
challenges with homeschooling, this group expressed a particular concern regarding
the amount of individual work that the parents had to follow up on.
The shift from classroom-based to remote teaching was expected to result in
several new uses of digital tools. We asked parents to report on what kind of instructional practices their child would engage with on a typical day of homeschooling.
As shown in Fig. 7.3, Real-time instruction through Zoom, Teams, Skype, etc. was
more common with older students than their younger counterparts.
While 60% of parents with students in lower secondary school reported that
this was typical instruction for homeschooling during the Pandemic, only 16% of
the youngest children engaged in such instruction on a typical day. About a third
of the parents across all grade levels reported that pre-recorded videos with the
teacher were typical. Tasks from the teacher were by far the most characteristic
aspect of homeschooling, as 96% (lower secondary school), 97% (grades 5–7), and
98% (grades 1–4) of parents reported that such tasks would be assigned on a normal
day of homeschooling. The figure also shows how contact with the teacher and
other students through chat increases with age. While 82% of the students in lower
secondary school chatted with the teacher or with classmates, only half (54%) of
the parents with students in the lowest grades reported the same. We also asked the
parents what kind of learning their children had done most of during a typical day.
We identified a clear tendency with little difference between the grade groups, as
95% of all parents reported that this would be individual work with tasks. Only 2%
reported that collaborative tasks were the most common, 2% reported that the most

typical was instruction on Zoom, Skype, Teams, or similar software, and 1% said
they did not know the most common form of teaching activity.
Contact with teachers
A crucial question when it comes to providing equal opportunities to learn for all
students is teacher availability and engagement. We asked parents to report on how
often students had contact with their teachers, specifying both written and oral
contact—through chat on the school’s learning system, digital video meetings, SMS,
or phone calls, for example. As summarized in Fig. 7.4, the responses revealed
substantial variation across grade levels.
The responses to this question revealed quite striking differences. In general, the
older the student, the more contact they had with their teacher. While most students
in lower secondary school had daily contact with their teachers, either once a day
(29%) or multiple times a day (42%), over half of the students in grades 1–4 had
contact with their teacher 2–3 times a week or less. The fact that 7% of the parents
with children in grades 1–4 reported no contact with teachers during the period of
homeschooling is quite concerning. However, it should also be noted that, when
parents were asked if they felt they could contact teachers during the homeschooling
period, a clear majority of parents answered that they felt they could contact the school
to a large degree (52%) or to some degree (33%). Some parents (12%) reported they
could contact the school to a low degree, and finally 3% reported uncertainties about
whether they could contact their child’s teacher.

How did students and parents experience homeschooling?
To learn more about how homeschooling was experienced compared to ordinary
school, we asked parents to compare the two and rate the degree to which (little, some,
large, do not know) they agreed with several claims. We asked them whether they had
spent more time than they typically would on helping their child with schoolwork;
whether following up with their child had harmed their own work performance;
whether they had to monitor their child continuously to ensure progress; whether
homeschooling had resulted in more insight about their child’s education; and finally,
whether it was understandable and clear what the school expected from the student.
The tendency here was that the parents of the youngest children spent far more time
following up with their children than parents in the lower secondary grades (7–10),
as shown in Figs. 7.5, 7.6, and 7.7.
These questions illuminated differences between the grades, revealing that parents
with younger children had been significantly more involved in monitoring their children’s schoolwork. This finding implies that younger children with parents who were
not able to follow up on their child’s schoolwork were in a very vulnerable position,
not only because other parents were helping their children but also because teachers
monitored children in grades 1–4 the least during homeschooling (see Figs. 7.2
and 7.4). In one item, we asked parents to report on how much time they usually
spent a day following up on their child’s schoolwork, and the responses confirmed
this tendency. As many as 85% of the parents with children in grades 1–4 reported
spending 1–2 h or more on schoolwork a day, while this was the case for only 24%
of parents with children in grades 8–10.
We also asked parents to report on how much their child engaged in schoolwork
during the Pandemic compared to the duration of a normal school day. The parents

reported a clear tendency for students to work less compared to an ordinary school
day. Overall, 31% of the parents reported that their child used less than half of the
duration of a normal school day for school; 24% reported that students used more than

around the same amount of time for school; and finally, 14% reported that students
spent more time on school than the equivalent of a normal school day. Figure 7.8

Fig. 7.8 Percentage of parents who reported how much time their children spent on homeschooling

As shown in Fig. 7.8, most students in the lower grades (1–4) worked less than
normal during homeschooling. For students in the lower secondary grades (8–10),
the situation was quite different: most of these students spent about the same amount
of time—or more—than they normally would on schoolwork. This finding can have
multiple explanations, including that these students were monitored more closely by
their teachers and that, unlike students in primary classrooms, they also received
grades for their schoolwork during the Pandemic. Students in lower secondary

school are also more used to working individually and using digital tools for schoolwork, which may have allowed them to handle homeschooling better and more
independently than their younger peers.
The findings that parents were more involved in following up with younger
students, that teachers were less involved in following up with younger students,
and that younger students spent the least amount of time on schoolwork during
the Pandemic compared to ordinary schooling suggest that homeschooling has
challenged some key ideas of Nordic schooling. They have challenged the notion
that one’s school performance should not be dependent on one’s socioeconomic
background, which we will discuss further in the final part of the chapter.
How was the homeschool experience for the students?
Parents were asked to assess how it was for their child to engage in the learning
activities provided during homeschooling. Five statements described positive aspects
and four statements described more challenging aspects. We used a 5-point scale with
the response alternatives always, often, sometimes, seldom, and never, as well as the
possibility to answer I do not know. In Fig. 7.9 we report the percentage of parents
who answered always or often for each item describing positive aspects, and in
Fig. 7.10 we report the percentage of parents who answered always or often for each
item describing challenging aspects with homeschooling.
With the positive aspects reported in Fig. 7.9, parents with children in grades
1–4 reported that they have had the most insight into what their child was doing
at school, as this response is very much in line with their answers to other items.
Regarding the more challenging aspects of homeschooling and remote learning, we
see again that except for skipping classes, the parents of younger children reported
challenges to occur more often than the parents of the older students did. With a clear

majority of parents at home, it is perhaps not surprising that very few of the youngest
students skipped classes. 17% of parents of students in grades 8–10 reported that
skipping class happened often or always. The parents of the younger children reported
greater challenges with getting students to engage with schoolwork and being able
to self-regulate their own schoolwork. The findings in Fig. 7.10 also indicate that
homeschooling was more manageable for older students, who on average had fewer
problems working individually with tasks.
A clear majority of the parents (81%) reported that their child missed ordinary
school to a large degree or to some degree. While a few parents expressed in the openended questions that their child preferred homeschooling and learned more during
this time, there were far more parents with open-ended responses who described that
their child missed contact with classmates and that the lack of social contact due to
homeschooling was very challenging. This finding is in line with Qvortrup (2020),
who documented that Danish students missed the social aspects of teaching.
Main challenges of homeschooling in the parents’ own words
We identified some trends in the responses to the open-ended questions, but it should
be noted that this part of the survey really shows how individual parents have experienced the Pandemic differently. On one end of the spectrum are parents who expressed
that this time was extremely hard, that their child missed their friends and worried
about older family members getting sick, and that the amount of fighting between
parents had increased. At the other end of the spectrum are parents who referred to
the Pandemic times at home as a “gift for the family” because they were close to
each other every day while schoolwork was more successful than ever, and their child
was happier and learning more than they ever did during normal schooling. As such,
the trends we will report here are not descriptive for all participating parents; rather,

7 Homeschooling in Norway During the Pandemic-Digital Learning …

these trends express themes that were the most prominent in the parents’ responses
concerning both challenges and silver linings. We will start by reporting on issues
many parents found challenging.
One open-ended question asked parents to explain in their own words what they
experienced as challenging with the homeschool situation. Parents across grade levels
often mentioned that it was difficult to combine their own work from home with
helping children, as illustrated in the following examples of parents’ responses:
The first grader needs to be monitored very closely, and that is not compatible with the degree
of our independent work at our home office. Apart from the weekly plan with assignments
that we received, there has been no teaching or direct contact between student and teacher.
(Parent of a boy, 1st grade)
Even though I am not continuously helping, the homeschooling interrupts the home office
so much that I am not able to do my job. (Parent of a girl, 2nd grade)
We are several people at home, three with homeschool and one or two in the home office.
This is challenging when it comes to both noise and space. It is also challenging to be in a
full-time job and at the same time be available for three students in homeschooling! (Parent
of a girl, 8th grade)

The fact that many parents found home schooling so demanding also indicates
how requiring students to learn from home seriously challenges equity ideals, as
parents’ ability to provide students with support varied. We know, for instance, that
some parents had to prioritize their own work over their children’s schooling, if, for
example, they were small business owners trying to prevent their business from going
bankrupt. The actual difference between home environment and support is evident in
the open-ended answers, where some parents describe providing very close support
that increased learning motivation and even student achievement according to the
parents, while others describe how guilty they feel for not being able to follow
up school as much as they would like. Closely related to the issue of combining
one’s own work with children’s schooling, many responses indicated that it was
time-consuming to follow up on the students’ work. Many parents stated that it was
demanding to take on the role of the teacher for their own child, who may not be
willing to let them have that role. Two parents of third-grade students explained this
situation below:
It has not always been easy to explain assignments because my son does not always want to
listen to what I have to say. I’m not his teacher … and I’m probably not suitable as a teacher
either :-). (Parent of a boy, 3rd grade)
Parents neither know the current pedagogy nor the teacher’s methods. Parents are NOT
educators. (Parent of a girl, 3rd grade)

The clear trend in parent responses regarding challenging aspects of remote
teaching was that homeschooling was time-consuming and demanded that parents
follow the students’ work carefully, especially with the younger grades. As in other
studies (Bubb & Jones, 2020), several parents expressed increased admiration for
teachers because they experienced firsthand how difficult it was to motivate students
for all kinds of tasks. Regarding equity, it should it also be noted that while we did
not have a specific item in the survey about students with special needs, some parents

194

M. Blikstad-Balas et al.

who did have such students described how these students were not being followed up,
and that their school was failing to provide them with equal learning opportunities:
The assignments they get are not adapted to each student, for example special needs are not
taken into account (Parent of a boy, 1st grade)
My child has dyslexia and is not given the adapted education she usually would get in school.
It is demanding to help her when none of us at home are (special) educators. (Parent of a
girl, 2nd grade)
My son is entitled to special need education – it is not being followed up (Parent of a boy,
grade 8)

This is consistent with the research done by Federici and Vika (2020), who identified that only 27% of teachers in primary and lower secondary school and 23%
of teachers in upper secondary school in Norway reported that they were able to
follow up with vulnerable students who needed special support during the period of
home schooling (Federici & Vika, 2020). This shows, again, that home schooling
in Norway “outsourced” (to the parents) an explicit national educational principle
during the Pandemic, namely that each student should have an adapted learning environment providing equal learning opportunities for all (The Norwegian Directorate
of Education and Training, 2021b).
Main beneﬁts of homeschooling in the parents’ own words
In the survey, we also included an open-ended question that asked parents to explain
in their own words what they experienced as benefits with the homeschool situation.
Most responses revolved around getting better insight into what a typical school day
consists of and what is expected of the students in different subjects. The following is
a typical example of answers highlighting the parents’ new insight into their child’s
schoolwork:
We loved homeschool. We have had more time together, I have acquired greater insight
into the schoolwork, we have talked more about the tasks they have been given, and we
have reflected on the fact that it is important to practice several times to become good at
something. For us, homeschooling has been golden and something we could continue to do
for a long time. (Parent of a girl, 2nd grade)

Further, many parents agreed that the increased flexibility of when to do what and
how to organize the school day was a welcome benefit. This response is in line with
the OECD finding that homeschooling increased student autonomy and their ability
to manage their own learning (Reimers & Schleicher, 2020), as illustrated by this
parent response:
It is different. The student manages his own time better. He mostly finishes schoolwork during
the normal hours of school and does not have to spend the afternoon doing homework. (Parent
of a boy, 8th grade)

More family time was another benefit expressed by many parents across grade
levels. This finding is connected to the increased flexibility that came with homeschool, where parents were able to structure the school day (and their workday) as
they wanted and spend more time together engaging in physical activities like skiing
and hiking:

7 Homeschooling in Norway During the Pandemic-Digital Learning …

195

It was nice that there was some flexibility in relation to when the tasks had to be completed, so
we had the opportunity to take a break in the middle of the day and go for longer cross-country
skiing trips. (Parent of a girl, 2nd grade)
He has become more interested in physical activity, including running, strength training, and
skiing with us. (Parent of a boy, 8th grade)
The student is very interested in the tasks and spends a lot of time on schoolwork, in addition
to being able to exercise a lot every day (especially skiing). (Parent of a girl, 10th grade)

While these responses are positive, we also know that the best performing students
during homeschool in Norway were those that were more physically active according
to their parents (Roe et al., 2021). Again, we would like to underscore the variation
in the material. While the responses indicated a trend of seeing flexibility for more
family time, including time outdoors, as a benefit, parents also expressed their worries
about screen time and lack of physical activity.

7.6 Discussion
A key aspect of the Nordic model is the idea that all students, irrespective of social,
economic, and geographical background, should have the same educational opportunities (Klette, 2018). The Coronavirus Pandemic has the potential to aggravate
social inequality, as all education has taken place in each student’s own home
(Azevedo et al., chapter 16; Doyle, 2020; Reimers, chapter 1). The survey data we
have presented here suggests that this is very much the case in Norway, for several
interrelated reasons that we would like to discuss further.
First, a key finding of our survey is significant variation in how much contact
teachers had with their students and to what degree parents were assumed to be
involved in the learning activities. While students in upper secondary school were
expected to show up digitally in their classroom up to several times a day, many
students in lower grades, especially the youngest students in grades 1–4, were not
monitored in the same manner. In many ways, the youngest students are the most
vulnerable ones, as they are often the least capable of administering their own learning
and managing their own tasks. Paradoxically, these children had the least contact with
their teachers and least frequently had real-time instruction through digital software
like Zoom or Teams. Some students in the lower grades of primary school went
weeks without contact with their teacher at a time when the official policy was to
keep teaching full school days remotely. This expectation dramatically increases
parental involvement in schooling, as found in other studies (Bubb & Jones, 2020).
While many parents in our survey reported that they had spent a significant amount
of time each day following up with their children’s schoolwork, the basic idea of
the Nordic school system is to avoid the implicit assumption that all children have
access to qualified help at home, as we know that unfortunately such support is not
universal.
As Krumsvik (2020) noted, it is important for educational researchers to investigate different aspects of the educational consequences of the Pandemic to avoid the

196

M. Blikstad-Balas et al.

domination of anecdotal evidence about how the shutdown has affected students’
lives. This is particularly important considering the World Health Organization’s
(WHO, 2020) prediction of more global pandemics in the future. We should therefore also ask if there are any didactical lessons to be learned here concerning the
teaching practices that were the essence of homeschooling.
An important finding in our survey is that, while teachers in Norway have been
expected to draw on digital tools across all school subjects and grades since 2006
(Erstad, 2006; Wieberg Klausen, 2020), this has not resulted in a shared digital
repertoire of practices across, or even within, schools. Our survey shows some use of
real-time instruction through digital platforms (more so in lower secondary grades
than with younger students), but this was a limited part of homeschooling. The
responses indicated that by far the most dominant educational activity was to let
students complete tasks individually. This trend is significant if one is concerned
with equity in education. Previous studies from Scandinavia indicate that individualized teaching methods, where students must decide themselves how and when
to work, may put too much burden on the students (Dalland & Klette, 2014, 2016;
Klette, 2018). Klette (2007, p. 352) argues, in an article about individualized teaching
methods (such as the use of individual work plans with tasks to be done weekly),
that this was particularly problematic for low achievers, who became responsible
for “regulating their own failure at school”. Individualized teaching methods will
reinforce the individual background of the students, and by doing so produce fewer
equal opportunities for all.
When schools opened again in May 2020, the Minister of Education explicitly
underscored in a press release that the most vulnerable children had not been monitored well enough during the period when schools were closed (Ministry of Education
and Research, 2020). She also expressed that the youngest students learned the least
during homeschooling. In line with our survey data presented here, this raises questions about whether more could have been done to ensure access to high-quality
instruction for all during the Pandemic. One could ask why there was not more use
of collaborative tasks and virtual possibilities to connect students in a time when
many missed their everyday social life at school. It should also be questioned why
the youngest students had the least variation in how they were taught as well as the
least use of digital technology that enables real-time interaction.
When we claim that the youngest students in many ways are the most vulnerable
ones, it should not overshadow the fact that there are vulnerable students in all age
groups. A student survey in Norwegian lower secondary school (grades 8–10) during
the school closure by Mæland et al. (2021), found a tendency of lower efforts and
self-efficacy among low achieving students, and the authors explicitly state that this
trend may be difficult to reverse in reopened schools. A finding from our study that
adds to this concern is that parents with children who have special needs describe
that these needs have not been followed up during the Pandemic, and that they—the
parents—are the ones who then must adapt the instruction and help as much as they
can. This is reported by parents not only for the youngest children, but across grade
groups. It is also consistent with other research on special needs education during
the Pandemic (Federici & Vika, 2020).

7 Homeschooling in Norway During the Pandemic-Digital Learning …

197

There is limited research on the effect of the Pandemic on different groups
of students, but Doyle (2020) emphasized that some evidence has suggested that
school closures may have a greater impact on students with a lower socioeconomic
background than their peers. Our survey shows some concerning trends, in particular that homeschooling was largely dependent on parental involvement. The great
variety in how different schools practiced homeschooling, especially concerning
attendance requirements and how closely and frequently teachers followed up on
their students also raises both short-term and long-term concerns about the effects of
homeschooling. As Doyle (2020) also underscored, some students will benefit from
homeschooling if their parents can monitor them even better than a teacher could. In
response to our open-ended questions, parents offered some descriptions that highlight this exact point: for some students, Pandemic homeschooling exceeded normal
schooling in terms of both learning and motivation. However, the big question is what
the long-term consequences are for all students, parents, and teachers who were not
able to make the most out of the homeschool situation.
Sending each student to their own home to take part in remote learning for months
will, for many, increase the impact of socioeconomic background on education. This
is not surprising, but it makes it more important to really address the great variety of
teaching students were offered during homeschool. As we see it, the most important
take-home message from our research is that good digital equipment both at home
and at school, as well as national curricula that highlights digital competence are
not enough to ensure that all students are monitored as well as possible through
remote teaching. As Soudien et al. (chapter 12) emphasize, the Pandemic has been
an extremely challenging period for teachers. We have every reason to trust that
Norwegian teachers did what they could in a very demanding situation, and there is
evidence that school leaders and teachers were concerned about the most vulnerable
students and that many local school leaders developed guidelines on how to support
these students during the period of school closure (Federici & Vika, 2020). It is
therefore of paramount importance to not blame individual teachers for the suffering
of vulnerable students during the Pandemic, but to recognize that the Norwegian
national response did not attempt to equalize opportunities to learn from remote
teaching. Rather, the national response completely overlooked the inequalities in
access to qualified help that already existed.
Our study also sheds light on the shared ambitions missing from remote teaching
and the missing shared repertoire on ways to engage children in social, real-time
interaction in a time that every child—and especially those in vulnerable situations—could benefit from interaction with their teachers and classmates. This is
an important lesson for the future, not only because the amount of individual work in
itself challenges equal opportunities, but because there are several studies indicating
that students missed each other and the social arena that school is supposed to be
during the period of closed schools (Bakken et al., 2020; Qvortrup, 2020).

7.7 Conclusion
In many ways, sending children to school is all about sending them away from
their home environment to equalize their opportunities to learn—regardless of the
opportunities and constraints they were born into. As Andreas Schleicher writes in
his introduction to the OECD (2018, p. 3) report on equity in education, “what wise
parents want for their children is what the government should want for all children”.
Given that equity for all is such an explicit ambition of the Nordic welfare model, it
is very concerning that the Norwegian Government’s response to the Pandemic did
not offer any national guidance to support all students, and that teachers, parents and
students were left alone to maintain the high expectations in the national curriculum
as best they could—without any acknowledgement of the very unequal access to
qualified help students had in their own homes.

The Portuguese Educational Policy
to Ensure Equity in Learning in Times
of Crises
Estela Costa, Mónica Baptista, and Carolina Carvalho

Abstract This study aims to analyze the Portuguese government policy pronouncements to face COVID-19 and to examine how the policy measures have been enacted
and interpreted by teachers to ensure equity in learning. The study is rooted on a
cognitive approach to public policy, and grounds on the notion of the référentiel. A qualitative and interpretative methodology was used, based on the analysis of
official and public documents prepared and made available during the confinement
period (March to July 2020) on the Ministry of Education website. Also, interviews were conducted with 15 teachers from various Portuguese schools. Findings
show that public authorities quickly responded using informative (e.g., websites to
support schools, a TV program, YouTube channels) and communicational (e.g., Facebook, a platform for school principals, email to pose questions) tools. Moreover, the
pandemic crisis put equity issues at the center of all concerns and led to the discussion
around equity in education to become more pronounced. The differences between
distance and in person learning have been made clear while vulnerable students were
forced to stay at home, with little or no conditions to learn and without support for
studying. We conclude that the general guiding principles behind the policy measures
to combat the pandemic at the state and school level were based in a referential that
incorporates the constitutional right of ‘school for all’, which is focused on schools’
educational role, while also assigning schools social and economic responsibilities.

8.1 Introduction
In Portugal, the population was suddenly surprised by the coronavirus in spring 2020.
This planetary health crisis was to become a headache for public health authorities,
and especially for policymakers, who had to quickly take the necessary political
measures to mitigate the effects of the pandemic in various sectors.
In education, these policy responses have been associated with issues of social
justice and equity. In fact, the complexity of the reality associated with the pandemic

in the education sector has highlighted the urgent need to find answers for the full
realization of the Sustainable Development Goals (UNESCO, 2015) and the 2030
Agenda (idem), whereas equity is placed at the center of international development.
In these high-level policy documents, it is strongly recommended that all member
states ensure inclusive and equitable education for all, including children and young
people in vulnerable situations and at risk of exclusion from education.
In Portugal, as in many other countries, children who face the greatest educational inequalities live in families most exposed to conditions of greatest risk of
social exclusion (CNE, 2019), and these are also those most exposed to the social
and economic consequences of the pandemic. When most countries decided to
temporarily close schools, and switch to distance education, as a way of reducing
the impact of the pandemic, equity in education has become a major concern. The
proliferation of distance learning is a worrying situation for students from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds, who are forced to stay at home in vulnerable
contexts unconducive to learning without the appropriate support.
This chapter is in line with empirical research (e.g., Ahmed et al., 2020; Álvarez
et al., 2020; Holguín & Sandoval, 2020) that aimed to identify the actions implemented by governments all over the world, and to analyze the implications for
ensuring the equity of student learning.
This prompts the following research question: How equitable was student learning
in the Portuguese context during the COVID-19 pandemic from March to July 2020?
To answer the question, two main objectives were defined: (i) to analyze the policy
measures adopted by the Portuguese government to face COVID-19; (ii) to examine
how the policy measures have been enacted and interpreted by teachers to ensure
equity in learning.
This qualitative and interpretative study was based on the analysis of official
and public documents prepared and made available during the confinement period
(March to July 2020) on the Ministry of Education website, and on the analysis of
interviews conducted with teachers from various Portuguese schools.
This study has been developed within the scope of a cognitive and normative
approach that emphasizes the importance of values and ideas in policy making (Surel,
2019), and is based on an understanding of public policies as courses of action
directed at a specific area of society/territory on the part of an authority invested with
public power and government legitimacy (Thoenig, 2019).
Public policy influences various sectors (education, justice, etc.) by adapting
and/or transforming them. According to the cognitive approach of policies, this action
on society by the government is based on ideas and values that those actors involved
in the fabrication and reception of policies carry with them (Muller, 2018). In this
sense, cognition and norms are very relevant to the study of policies. First, because
actors only can intervene when they have an ‘idea’ about what to expect when they
act (cause-effect relationship); second, because “norms and values are what motivate actors, telling them what they should and what they should not do” to solve the
problems (Braun & Capano, 2010, p. 3).
To investigate the educational policies adopted during the pandemic and enacted
by the school actors, within the scope of the cognitive approach of policies, we

Fig. 8.1 A visual representation of a version Muller’s référentiel prepared by the authors

used the notion of référentiel (referential) as defined by Bruno Jobert and Pierre
Muller (Jobert & Muller, 1987). When a policy is produced, it involves creating a
representation that we build of the reality on which we want to intervene. We call
this representation a “policy referential”, which once received and interpreted by the
social actors, should consider the problems of the policy, and look for solutions to
define how to act (Muller, 2018). As can be seen in Fig. 8.1, the referential is based on
four levels of perception: values, norms, algorithms, and the images (Muller, 2018).
Values are representations about what is good and bad, what should be desirable or
disadvantageous (e.g., the debate between equity vs. equality); norms express the gaps
between what is observed and what is desirable. Above all, they define principles
of action: ‘this must be done like this’ (e.g., “agriculture must be modernized”);
algorithms define causal relationships that indicate the principles of action, i.e., they
reveal a theory of action and can be expressed in the form of “if …, then” statements
(e.g. “If I transfer the policies to combat social exclusion from the State to local
entities, then public policies will be more effective because they are closer to the
stakeholders”); finally, images can be presented in the form of slogans that have the
previous three levels implicit. They are short phrases with strong cognitive appeal
that give meaning immediately, without the need for a long speech (e.g., “the dynamic
and modern young farmer”) (Muller, 2018).
Therefore, the notion of referential is a matrix that we have used to analyze the
policy measures that were designed by public authorities to solve a specific problem
in education: the constraints imposed in education by COVID-19. Thus, it helped us
to understand how issues of equity and combating inequalities were considered in
policy measures and how teachers have interpreted those measures. In this work, the
deductive method was used to define the categories of data analysis, adopting the
first three levels of perception proposed by the author.
This chapter comprises four parts. The first part of the paper includes a brief
account of the Portuguese educational context, the policy measures implemented to
face the pandemic, and the research strategy. The second and third parts present the

results of the study, comprising the policy measures adopted by the State authorities
to face COVID-19 and the perceptions that teachers have regarding the policies. The
chapter closes with a summary of the key findings.

8.2 The Portuguese Education Context
In recent years, Portuguese schools have acquired more decision-making autonomy
over the curriculum, and in the administration of schools, through policies of curricular flexibility and the signing of autonomy agreements. However, despite the recent
increase in involvement of local partners, the educational system still is highly
centralized: “The Ministry of Education is responsible for defining the curriculum,
guidelines for national examinations (…), teacher recruitment and deployment, and
the budget at pre-primary, compulsory, and higher education levels” (OECD, 2014,
p. 15).
In particular, the Portuguese education system is organized in three sequential
levels: early childhood education and care, basic, and secondary education. As other
OECD countries, children enter in school through kindergarten and pre-school education is offered for children between the ages of 3 and 5. Compulsory education typically starts at the age of 6, when children enroll in basic schools. Basic compulsory
education is organized in three study cycles of varying lengths: 1st cycle (1st–4th
grades), 2nd cycle (5th–6th grades), 3rd cycle (7th–9th grades) and secondary education, which is organized in both general and vocational education pathways. In the
general track, students select one of four curricular areas: science and technologies, social and economic sciences, languages and humanities, or visual arts. Formal
schooling in Portugal is compulsory for students until 18 years old or until the
completion of upper secondary if students complete their studies before the age of
18 (Liebowitz et al., 2018).

8.3 Policy Measures to Face the COVID-19 Pandemic
In Portugal, during the third school term in spring 2020, the coronavirus pandemic
came about and caught public authorities off guard, forcing civil society and policymakers to join efforts to address the crisis. In addition to legislation, different policy
measures and instruments were taken, which emanated from public authorities to
help schools to cope with the effects of the pandemic (Table 8.1).
The measures to be taken in education increased gradually until the pandemic
reached its peak alongside the decision to confine the entire population, through
a Communiqué of the Council of Ministers of March 19, 2020.3 The confinement
started on March 22, shortly after school attendance has been suspended, on March

daily television classes. It was broadcast until
the end of the school year from 9:00 am to
5:50 pm, with relevant content for
consolidation and development of students
learning systematized for different school
years. The program was structured in
thematic blocks, consisting of 30-min
sessions, and was developed by teams of
teachers from eight schools in the country,
who made themselves available to develop
this activity in addition to their regular work
in their schools. Each block was inserted in a
sequential planning, but could be used
independently, comprising also moments of
systematization, and containing varied
instruments and resources and diversified

16, and just before the end of the 2nd term. Schools remained closed until the end of
the school year, in what appeared as a peaceful and unanimous decision in Portugal.4
In fact, an online questionnaire sent to 1,754 parents showed that 92.5% of the
Portuguese agreed with the government’s decision (Benavente et al., 2020). Moreover, the rate of student participation has always been regular right from the beginning
of school closures (between 76 and 100%), with secondary education showing higher
values, certainly due to a greater autonomy of secondary students and because there is
a greater availability of digital media at this level of education (ME/DGEEC, 2020).

8.4 Methodological Approach
Research strategy
In this study, we followed a qualitative research methodology, based on an interpretive
approach (Cohen et al., 2007), to examine how the equity of students’ learning was
ensured in the Portuguese context during the pandemic from March to July 2020.
The data collection instruments used were written documents and interviews.
Written documents available online have made it possible to respond to the first
research objective: to analyze the policy measures adopted by the Portuguese government to face COVID-19. Through the institutional websites, the internet has been a
government instrument, and a way to communicate with students and families.
The collection totaled 17 documents, considering the following criteria: all
documents referred to the period between March and July 2020, were integrated
in the pages of official websites, were written by public authorities during the
pandemic period, and were available on institutional portals (government, educational administration). The collection also consisted of official reports, legislation,
communications.
The interviews aimed to examine the second research objective, about the perceptions of teachers on how they interpreted the policy pronouncements to ensure equity
in learning. The interviews have been prepared based on Mainardes (2006) interpretation of Stephan Ball’s work, to capture how school actors have interpreted the policies
enacted by state authorities and perceived their effects on students learning. Therefore, the interviews have been constructed to discern school actors’ perceptions about
policy measures and especially their effects on vulnerable students. Fifteen teachers
aged between 38 and 61 were interviewed. They were selected taking into account
the following criteria: (1) they are part of the RedeEscola (SchoolNetwork5 ) of I EULisbon and therefore were working on projects coordinated by the first or second
authors of this chapter; (2) they teach in diverse schools from different regions of
the country (North, Center, Lisbon and Tagus Valley and Alentejo); (3) they teach
various disciplines and teaching cycles (from primary and secondary education).
4 Only early childhood education establishments had reopened (on June 1st), and part of secondary

(on May 18th), for students with exams to access Higher Education.

For the analysis of documents and interview transcripts, the deductive method
was employed, using three categories of Muller’s referential: values, norms, and
algorithms (Muller, 2018). More specifically, the documents and transcripts were read
and then the targeted text was segmented to represent an idea related with the three
categories. Each segment was assigned a code and assigned a pre-defined category,
according to its features. The first two researchers independently analyzed data,
considering the categories of Muller’s model, comparing their analyses with each
other to achieve inter-rater reliability. Each difference in text coding decisions were
discussed until a consensus was reached. After this, based on the defined categories,
interpretive codes and two subcategories have emerged for each category (Table 8.2).
Policy measures adopted by public authorities to face COVID-19
In this section the text is organized around the pre-defined categories and the
subcategories that resulted from the text analysis.
Values
Right to education
The right to education as a principle of social justice underlies the measures taken
by the government with regards to education in the context of the pandemic. In
the various official texts, we found a conception of school as an entity that should
guarantee rights and equity. Therefore, in April 2020, the presidency of the Council of
Ministers launched exceptional and temporary measures under the imperative of “the
continuity of the 2019/2020 academic year, in a fair, equitable and as a normalized
manner as possible” (Portugal, 2020—Decree-Law n. º 14-G/2020, 13 April),6 which
were related to aspects of continued learning, including the assessment of students’
learning and the school calendar.
Likewise, #EstudoEmCasa has been launched with the associated message of
the Assistant Secretary of State and Education (ASSE) reinforcing that: “Now the
isolation is much stronger for the most vulnerable and it is again the time to put
ourselves in the other’s place and ask ourselves the question ‘What if it were me?’”.

8 The Portuguese Educational Policy to Ensure Equity …

211

Furthemore, #EstudoEmCasa has been presented as an intervention “for students
who do not have the facility or possibility to access the internet and the resources available there. Therefore, although available through cable, RTP Play, and the application
#EstudoEmCasa, transmission via the RTP Memory channel ensures that everyone
with a television can access these resources”.7
Students in this vulnerable situation have been identified in more than a third of
schools (38% of schools with 1st cycle and 2nd cycle; 36% of schools with 3rd cycle).
Most schools that reported students receiving educational content solely through
#EstudoEmCasa had complemented it with other strategies to involve students in the
teaching, learning, and assessment processes. These strategies were primarily based
on the proposal of activities to be carried out by the students while maintaining a
regular contact with the teacher-mentor and supported by monitoring by the Multidisciplinary Support Team for Inclusive Education. A smaller number of schools
opted for other strategies, including regular contact with the students’ classes.
Simultaneously, the Portugal Post Office and the National Scouts sent work documents and proposals from schools to students and facilitated the return of these
materials to teachers. Similarly, other initiatives have been set in motion locally.
After students were identified by schools, their families were directly contacted.
Moreover, when students still did not have access to the internet, postal service
workers, volunteers, teachers, and school staff, in an articulated collaboration
between municipalities, schools, and parents’ associations, took the teaching materials to families (transporting materials between students and teachers). Municipalities and various stakeholders have also been highly committed to providing families
with tablets and computers (targeting, for example, families with many children, so
that more children could simultaneously access the internet).
For disadvantaged students who had not received tablets or laptops from municipalities, donations from individuals and local partners helped fill this digital access
gap. Moreover, several school partners (e.g., local institutions, social support institutions, foundations, global non-governmental organizations, etc.) and schools’
libraries were utilized by students on a rotating basis.
School autonomy
As we have seen above, the responsibility of coping with the pandemic has not been
entirely state centered. It has been shared with schools, which have been responsible
for taking decisions and adapting policy action to their local realities. Accordingly,
as they faced the suspension of face-to-face teaching, the government, through a
Decree-Law,8 encouraged the use of methodologies that schools considered the most
appropriate, according to the guidelines of the Ministry of Education (ME). There
was a concerted effort by schools to adapt to the new constraints: the most used
resources were the physical and virtual manuals, followed by the proposals of online
publishers, the resources shared on the internet, and those built individually. These
resources were built collectively by schools, started in the order of 50% (in March)

212

and increased to 70% in June (ME/DGEEC, 2020). Therefore, decision-making about
pedagogical strategies to face COVID-19 have increasingly been centered on schools
that developed different strategies based on their contextual idiosyncrasies.
Likewise, #EstudoEmCasa has been portrayed as “a complement and as a support
resource intended primarily for students without connectivity and/or equipment,
regardless of other uses that might be made by teachers, through their inclusion in the
E@D plans of each education establishment” (site #EstudoEmCasa).9 It was then
conceived as a complement and a resource that has been made available to teachers
and students, as stressed in the document “9 Guiding Principles for Follow-up of
Students using #EstudoEmCasa”.10 One important concern has been to maintain
the link between students and teachers to reduce any pernicious effects caused by
physical distance:
#EstudoEmCasa it is not the replacement of the school. This is a school that is close by, always
in articulation with the one that currently has their doors closed, but whose professionals are
“in line” to bridge the distances.11

Accordingly, schools always received, in advance, the schedule grid, the contents
of each educational block, and support materials and proposals for activities to be
developed.
Norms
Social support
The communication12 that has been sent to schools to inform that face-to-face
classes would be suspended, instructed schools to support students educationally
and socially. Although closed, schools have had a duty to provide school meals to
students supported by social services: “each school, together with the municipalities and other providers, should find the most effective and safest way to ensure the
meals”.
This indication has been reinforced with the publication of the Decree-Law n.
º 10-A/202013 that stipulated that schools should adopt “the necessary measures
for the provision of food support to students benefiting from (…) school social
action”, as well as, whenever necessary, “to students from specialized units that have
been integrated into learning support centers and whose permanence in school is
considered indispensable.” (artº 9º).
In these official texts there is a conception of schools and their professionals as
those who have been assigned social and economic responsibilities, such as ensuring
‘essential services in combating the pandemic’, and creating in the network of public
schools childcare services for essential service workers (Ordinance No. 82/2020, of

March 19)14 (e.g. health professionals, security and rescue forces and services, firefighters, armed forces, professionals in the management and maintenance of essential
infrastructures, municipalities) (artº 10º, nº 1, 2). Thus, it can be read in the ordinance:
It is important that the professionals of the services identified in the present ordinance,
mobilized for the face-to-face service in this phase of exceptionality and emergency triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, can have a welcoming place for their children or other
dependents, in the absence of alternative solutions

Therefore, in each municipality, at least one educational establishment has been
identified to welcome children of essential service workers.15 Based on the need for
society to keep on working and to “guarantee the readiness of all essential services to
the fulfilment of citizens’ rights, freedoms and guarantees” (Ordinance No. 82/2020,
of March 19),16 school actors have been called upon to help to provide access to
services in schools for extrinsic purposes of a labor and socio-economic nature.
Teaching at distance
Decree-Law no. 14-G/2020, of 13 April, stipulated the need for each school to “define
and implement a distance learning plan, with the appropriate methodologies for the
available resources and evaluation criteria, which take into account the contexts of
students” (art. 2, point 2).17 The plan has turned out to be the main strategic instrument
of schools to organize their educational work during the period of suspension of
classroom activities. To this end, the ministry’s website “Apoio às escolas” has been
created to offer “a set of resources to support schools in the use of distance learning
methodologies that allow them to continue the teaching and learning processes”.18
Likewise, schools have been provided access to Microsoft Teams and Zoom platforms, which were free to use through institutional emails. Microsoft Teams was
offered free to students as part of Office 365, providing a space for tasks, videos,
and proposals, and more recently for the students’ assessment (feedback space). The
Zoom platform was also widely used to provide remote meetings and classes while
allowing the sharing of documents and involving many students in a synchronous
interaction.
To support schools in the context of inclusive education, public authorities also
have produced the document ‘Guidelines for the work of Multidisciplinary Support
Teams for Inclusive Education in the form of E@D’.19 Additionally, the ‘Guidelines

for the Bilingual Teaching of Deaf Students in the E@D modality’20 were written to
promote the production of materials that could be made available on a school support
website.
Throughout this period, the preference for distance support prevailed. All schools
have a ‘Learning Support Center’ (LSC), which is an organizational structure to
support inclusion. During this period, in addition to on-site support for students for
whom this need was expressed, in most schools LSC supported students at a distance,
using adapted methodologies to meet the goals of inclusive education (ME/DGEEC,
2020). A different structure is the ‘Resource Centers for Inclusion’ (CRI), which
are specialized services existing in the community, accredited by the ME, which
supports and enhances a school’s ability to promote the educational success of all
students. In June, the tendency to coordinate with the CRIs was reinforced, which
reveals a greater awareness of the impact of the interruption of support and therapies
on student learning (idem).
Moreover, regarding #EstudoEmCasa, an electronic site21 associated with the
TV program was created by the ME. This site provided content for each grade
level, and each subject under analysis on TV were permanently made available,
in addition to working proposals to complement teachers work. An e-mail address
(estudemcasa@dge.mec.pt) was also created to clarify pedagogical issues related to
the TV program #EstudoEmCasa.
Algorithms
Technological educational responses
The need to physically keep people distant from one another has led to a policy
response facilitated through technologies. It is assumed that if remote education was
adopted, the infection would be mitigated, as referred to in the Decree-Law n. º
10-A/2020, March 13th (artº 9º)22 emanated from the presidency of the Council of
Ministers. This causal relationship expresses the norms (principles of action) of this
measure and favors technological responses to fulfil what has been “declared by the
World Health Organization, on January 30, 2020, as well as the classification of
the virus as a pandemic, on March 11, 2020, it is important to strategically protect
contingency rules for the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic” (Decree-Law n. º 10-A/2020,
March 13th). Therefore, the rationale behind the policy was that if those measures
were implemented and face-to-face classes suspended it would become a strong
contribution to safeguard people’s health. As a result, forms of remote education
were implemented, using diversified means of digital communication, as well as the
public television.
Therefore, public authorities made an effort to provide teachers with technological
responses that made it possible to work with students remotely. Digital solutions have
offered resources and strategies, new infrastructures for schools to use, and means

of accessing useful information through the Facebook page, where schools could
consult information and share documents and work strategies with students23 in
addition to a YouTube channel24 for sharing classes and educational initiatives.
Protective social responses
Some of the policy measures did respond more sharply to this causal association
between the actions and the expected result. In the case of #EstudoemCasa, there has
been an appeal of the Assistant Secretary of State and Education (ASSE) to fulfil the
goal of combating inequalities:
Broadcasting on television is not enough, because these contents do not guarantee learning
by themselves. They can be used by everyone, but they are not enough. They are themes and
work proposals, which only guarantee learning if students are accompanied and guided by
the possible ways, with the necessary partnerships.25

In this regard, the ASSE added it would encourage the mobilization of all school
actors to combat inequalities, “to be able to be close to those who are further away
during confinement.” In his speech, ASSE establishes a causal relationship, and links
#EstudoemCasa to ways of working that call for alignment and cooperation between
teachers.
This is a time for collaboration and cooperation. And it is a moment of praise for all teachers
who, in all our schools, feel themselves to reinvent themselves so as not to leave any students
behind.26

As noted above, it was possible to examine the values, norms and algorithms
that made up the referential of the policy adopted to face COVID-19. In legislation,
political documents, and in policymakers’ discourse, the substance of the policy was
the right to education for all associated with the autonomy of school actors to take
decisions locally with a diverse set of stakeholders. The norms to rule the action
of schools has consisted of implementing remote learning and a need to support
students, especially, the more vulnerable.

8.5 Enactment of Policies and Teachers’ Perceptions
In this section, the text is organized around the pre-defined categories and the subcategories that emerged from the analysis. The interviewees valued the right of all students
to access education and, despite differences between schools in how they manage
their autonomy in decision-making processes, this was also a matter appreciated by
the teachers interviewed. Therefore, in addition to values, it was possible to know

their perceptions regarding the norms and algorithms that make up the policies referential. Regarding the norms—the way things should be arranged in schools—during
the pandemic, teachers recognized the great value of focusing on the most vulnerable students and the modality of teaching at distance; this was especially true for
the DLP, due to its guiding and regulatory nature, which allowed teachers to have a
direction and follow it, and gave them more confidence in their individual practices.
Values
Right to education
The right to equal access to learning by students was mentioned by teachers during the
interviews as integral, and in their view, the use of digital platforms (e.g., Microsoft
Teams) and other resources (such as mail, Skype, WhatsApp, Moodle, mobile phones,
videos) has helped minimize inequalities in access to learning. In fact, most of the
teachers (87%) used digital platforms, recognized the importance of this resource
to monitor their students’ learning (87%), and ensure that students accessed their
classes (80%). These results are in line with national results that reveal that e-mail and
WhatsApp were the digital mediums most cited by 80% of respondents (ME/DGEEC,
2020). In this regard, referring to synchronous classes through platforms, a teacher
mentioned:
If there is an issue, a difficulty, we can resolve it immediately. The platform has the advantage
of being in real time, at that moment.

The importance given to technological tools that allows to give immediate feedback to students is also valued. Teachers stressed that this remote proximity and the
access to the students in real time is part of the success in combating inequalities:
There are things that are difficult to achieve without an interaction with the student ... and
the use of the platform was good for giving feedback instantly, and seeing the difficulties,
accompanying the student (…) in synchronous classes it is easier not to leave students behind,
it is not the same as the face-to-face classes, but we have managed to minimize inequality
situations and we know that they are in class and have access to the materials.

Moreover, the interviewees have pointed out that, in addition to the platforms for
remote teaching, they have used other infrastructures to communicate with students
and, above all, to ensure that everyone had had access to information, such as WhatsApp, email, and mobile phones. In this regard, for example, they mentioned the
need to use other technological solutions that allowed them to be in close interaction
with students and ensure that all students were able to access the activities of the
discipline:
The cell phone and email were very useful. There was a class with two gypsy students and
I realized that it was best to use the phone to communicate with them. They had come to
school to get the materials, but then what could they do with the materials? The oral message
is different from the written one and it has been important to have other ways of interacting
with them and with the majority of students.

#EstudoEmCasa has also been considered by 67% of the interviewees a means
for all students to have access to classes, especially those from more disadvantaged

8 The Portuguese Educational Policy to Ensure Equity …

217

socioeconomic backgrounds. According to a teacher who used to develop other online
activities, #EstudoEmCasa proved to be the most democratic platform because it
reached everyone in the same way, all the families and not only those who can buy
a computer:
I think, in this context, #EstudoEmCasa was important, because in some way it gave access
to classes to all students. Especially the most disadvantaged students, from socioeconomic
backgrounds with more difficulties, have accessed the contents, classes on TV. (…) Parents
may not have a computer (as in either case), but all students have a television. So, it was an
important initiative, and that’s why the gap is not so big (…) In my classes, I explored the
subjects of #EstudoEmCasa, but I also did other things. I used other materials, I put them to
experiment with materials they had at home.

However, #Estudo EmCasa has been implemented differently. For instance, 27%
of the interviwees chose to not explore it during synchronous classes, as described
in the following excerpt:
In my discipline, television includes two years conjointly; as a complementary activity it
is ok but developing my work with students becomes more difficult and I think it would
accentuate the inequalities, because those who have support at home can follow the program
and then they study it; those who have no one to accompany them at home, need the materials
that the teacher gives them and guides them.

Moreover, it was evident some teachers considered that students who do not have
support from families are also not encouraged to view the television program or have
help to explore the contents. Thus, they are at a disadvantage compared to students
who have this support from families. These teachers opt to develop close work with
students with greater socioeconomic difficulties, to reduce inequalities.
School autonomy
The perception of the interviewed teachers is that the schools had the autonomy to
decide whether they would use the remote teaching platform, define which one to
use, as well as make decisions about the use they would make of the public television
program. In some cases, it was not a teacher’s option, but a norm decided by school
management, as mentioned:
It was an option taken in my school cluster. We give our synchronous classes, we send
the materials to the students; those who have no chance of accessing synchronous classes,
because they do not have a computer or internet, they come to schools and pick up the
materials, and then use #EstudoEmCasa as a supplement (…) This has been defined by the
school cluster and all [teachers] follow these guidelines.

In other cases, the school’s response has been standardized, resulting from
collective decision-making, taken by the school’s administration and management
bodies:
Here, the class and school principals have played a key role. [In my school] (…), the decision
also involved the pedagogical and the department coordinators, [together] decided the plan
for the group and it was defined that we were going to use Teams for synchronous classes,
once a week (…); So, we have started with synchronous moments right at the start of
confinement and it was good because it allowed everyone to be more involved and we tried
to combat situations of inequality.

218

E. Costa et al.

Unlike this case, there were instances in which the school clusters have taken
the option to give a strong emphasis to #EstudoEmCasa and focusing synchronous
classes on the program, as one teacher mentioned:
In synchronous classes, we have only cleared students doubts about #EstudoEmCasa. The
school cluster decided that it would be used as a basis for learning. We have a large percentage
of students who come from disadvantaged neighborhoods and have economic difficulties and
we considered that #EstudoEmCasa would give everyone access to classes since all students
have television. It was a way of not favoring any group of students. In class, we asked
questions about #EstudoEmCasa.

Norms
Social support
In the interviews, teachers mentioned that, due to government rules, several schools
have continued to serve meals for students with greater economic difficulties:
The school had to guarantee food to some very needy students because there are several who
need it. The school is the place where they have access to food and sometimes, they only
have this meal and that is a reality in my school cluster. In this situation of confinement,
ensuring students’ meals was fundamental.

In addition to the protective social support given by schools, in the context of the
pandemic, schools were tasked with taking on other missions that go beyond their
intrinsic educational mission: working in collaboration with the municipalities, to
respond to the social and labor needs of local families. An interviewee has echoed
the welcoming of students up to 12 years old, whose parents worked at the forefront
of combating the pandemic:
Not all schools are operating with support services for families of health professionals, mine
is. This was organized by the municipality. There are not many students, but we have this
service for these students, and it is important to help parents who are fighting the pandemic.

Teaching at distance
The guiding role played by the DLP in the confinement period has been widely
recognized in the interviews. This plan was developed by the school clusters and put
into action during March and July 2020:
My school cluster made an E@D Plan and that was important. The plan helped everyone
to understand the platforms we were using, how we have organized ourselves during the
confinement, the methodologies we were going to follow, and the main interlocutors, the
class director, as well as the support and supervision team.

Another teacher stressed the importance of this DLP for students:
The plan was aligned with our educational project and its existence was important for
teachers, families and kids to have access to information (…). It ensured a set of guiding principles for teaching during the pandemic, and more than that a useful document for everyone
to be informed, to access.

8 The Portuguese Educational Policy to Ensure Equity …

219

The difficulties felt by schools in the amplification of this Strategic Plan were
mainly in relation to the learning assessment (25%), the diversification of work with
students (15%) and interventions in the scope of inclusive education (15%). However,
according to the ME (2020), schools have been working on the plans, between March
and June 2020, adjusting and improving them, which has resulted in a maturation
and consolidation of the DLP.
Algorithms
Technological educational responses
Following what has been previously mentioned, each school had to develop a DLP
for the temporary suspension of teaching activities to plan the measures and methodologies that were the most more appropriate in each of the implementing contexts.
As the teachers mentioned in the interviews, the DLP has been felt as integral in
responding to school needs during the confinement, guiding their action regarding
on how to act, what to do, and when to do it. The causal relationship behind this
instrument was that it would guide schools’ action strategically and technologically
while guaranteeing the right of education to students. In fact, as one of the teachers
reported, there has been a perception that it was only from the moment DLP was
defined and synchronous classes started that the quality of students’ learning has
been guaranteed:
My school took a while to react and define a plan for this situation. When I started to work
with students in a context of total confinement and without access to synchronous interaction,
I started to realize that it was not possible. It was difficult to assist the pupils, there were
many doubts and doing so by email was not enough. The pressure on our school started to
increase to ensure the quality of students’ learning, and the school management has taken
action.

The same happened in relation to the #EstudoemCasa program, as mentioned by
a teacher who, in his perspective, “only for itself, it does not guarantee access to
learning, but if we explore it with our students and value it in synchronous classes,
students give importance and feel that #EstudoemCasa can help them learn.”
Protective social responses
80% of teachers mentioned that some of their students did not have a computer at
home or had to share the computer with their families. Therefore, in their view,
providing access to these resources was essential to mitigate inequalities. In the
following excerpt, that aspect is very visible:
Microsoft Teams was very important for kids to have classes in real time and my school had
already developed the digital technology plan. Not everyone had access to computers and
the internet. In my class, there were still 4 or 5 students with more economic difficulties.
The school lent them computers to guarantee access to classes and our municipality was also
spectacular and arranged some computers for the kids. (…)

8.6 Conclusions
This chapter investigated the policy measures introduced by the Portuguese authorities to educate during the COVID-19 crisis and how these policies have been
perceived and interpreted by teachers to ensure equity in learning. We examined official and public documents prepared and made available during the first confinement
period (March to July 2020) by the Ministry of Education and conducted interviews
with 15 teachers from various schools in Portugal.
Our findings show that when schools were physically closed, issues of equity,
and social justice were particularly pronounced in the policy discourse, as students
with little access to technological devices or learning support were forced to study
at home.
These students at the center of this discourse tend to have less access to relevant
digital materials (e.g. laptop, computer, quality internet access), physical conditions
to work at home (e.g. quiet space to study and/or a desk), parental support (e.g.
familiarity with digital resources, socio-cultural capital of families, nutrition). Moreover, students with special educational needs, single parents, or large families are
also considerably vulnerable (Education International, 2020). The school closure
caused by COVID-19 is believed as likely to contribute to an increase in the number
of students who drop out by the time schools reopened. In addition, as there are
still many students who do not have computers and/or internet access, protective
social responses were taken to respond to inequalities, such as through broadcasting
television.
In the following section, we present the main ideas drawn from the results of this
study.
Policy tools
The analysis of the documents published between March and July 2020 showed that
public authorities quickly responded to the pandemic using two types of tools to reach
the school actors and students: informative and communicational. The informative
tools consisted of websites to support schools, provide information about distance
learning, best practices in teaching, as well as provide diverse information about
the implementation of the DLP and inclusive education. Also, a TV program and
YouTube channels were created for sharing classes and educational initiatives, along
with webinars. Regarding communicative tools, they were diverse, such as, Facebook
for consultation and sharing of documents, a platform for school principals’ questions
to be answered within 24 h, and an email to clarify #EstudoEmCasa for schools.
Therefore, public authorities offered varied resources to help to resolve teaching
problems, suggest strategies, and offer resources for remote teaching. Also, a set
of guidelines, instruments, and tools to assist teachers during the suspension of
classroom activities were prepared.

Policy Measures
By examining the policy measures implemented to cope with COVID-19, it has been
possible to apprehend the values, norms and algorithms that made up the referential of the Portuguese COVID-19 emergency policy. While the adoption of online
education was accepted as the key solution to maintaining educational goals, it has
also highlighted the vulnerabilities that exist in education systems in different countries and student inequalities (Di Pietro et al., 2020). Findings showed that schools’
closure has exposed students to new vulnerabilities. Therefore, regardless of the cycle
of studies they attended, students started to have less time on average dedicated to
curricular learning, and were forced to stay at home, sometimes with little or no
conditions to learn and without support for studying.
The policy referential of the emergency policy adopted in Portugal has been
highly focused on the need to ensure continuity of teaching activities remotely while
safeguarding that all students have access to it. Therefore, in legislation, political
documents, and in policymakers’ discourse, the right to education was the substance
of the policy. The relevance that was given to this constitutional value has also been
associated with the autonomy required by schools in taking decisions, on a local scale,
together with a broad network of stakeholders (e.g. municipalities, scouts, postal
office, parents associations, etc.), to face and mitigate the effects of COVID-19. This
has been particularly important for vulnerable students, in line with the ODS 4, which
requires quality, inclusive, and equitable education for all, so that no student is left
behind (UNESCO, 2019). In this sense, the principles of action (the norms) focused
mainly on switching from face-to-face classes to distance learning. Moreover, in
addition to the educational response, schools have provided childcare services for
essential service workers, and daily meals to approximately 2,600 students benefiting
from the School Social Action in March 2020, which increased to 14,000 students
in June 2020. The largest number of meals were served in the Metropolitan Area of
Lisbon (ME/DGEEC, 2020).
Teachers perceptions
Through the interviews, we were able to assess teacher perceptions regarding
the values, norms and algorithms that make up the policies referential. Therefore, the value—the right to equal access to learning—has been associated (i)
with synchronous classes, during which teachers promptly noticed if students were
following the activities. Also, they could resolve doubts, provide feedback and, above
all, interact with students (an aspect highly valued by the teachers); and (ii) with
#EstudoEmCasa, which teachers considered an inclusive strategy for all students,
with an even greater importance for those from more disadvantaged socioeconomic
backgrounds, especially when it is the only way for these students to access classes.
This is in line with a questionnaire applied online to 1,754 parents, whereas the
results revealed a notable preference for strategies that implied interaction, monitoring, and feedback. Therefore, the ability for students to clear up doubts with the
teacher via the internet was the option that were most welcomed as ‘Very Important’
(98.4%), followed by the use of distance learning platforms (95.3%), video lessons

222

E. Costa et al.

with interaction (95%), sending worksheets by email (90.6%), and the existence of
discussion groups on the internet (82.2%) (Benavente et al., 2020).
The value of autonomy to make decisions was also noted as important. Autonomy
was seen as the interface between the right to education, understood as a matter of
social justice, and the effective responses they can provide students and families.
Thus, the way schools make use of autonomy depends on their governing body’s
stance: in some cases, for example, the use of the TV program has been promoted
by the administration and the management bodies and implemented uniformly by
teachers; in other cases, school principals left this issue to the discretion of teachers,
and consequently, in the same school, there have been different ways of using the
TV program in online classes. In any case, the TV program was a basis for learning
and an instrument that was perceived as having an important role in reducing student
inequalities.
Regarding the norms, as we saw earlier, in the case of the neediest students,
the government established rules designed to combat inequality and provide social
support. Teachers recognized the value of focusing on the most vulnerable, and
have reinforced the importance of networking, that has been developed locally with
municipalities and other stakeholders. Teaching remotely was an official directive
based on a strategy which was valued by those interviewed.
In conclusion, results show that in documents and in interviews, similar ideas and
values were shared, such as the right to education and the need to support students
learning while minimizing inequalities. Through a traditional command and control
governing strategy, the government legislated to endorse schools as a public service
of social support, and a protective space for the rights of students and families. School
actors have been assigned social and economic responsibilities, assuming a duty to
provide school meals to students supported by social services and ensuring a network
of public schools’ childcare services for essential service workers (Ordinance No.
82/2020, of March 19).
The notion that schools can function as a mechanism to reduce social inequalities is
widely expressed in political documents and in the voices of the interviewed teachers.
Furthermore, the approach used by state authorities was not prescriptive but rather
suggestive by providing ideas for what could be done in schools for remote teaching,
and preparing a set of guidelines, instruments, and tools to assist the pedagogical
work during the suspension of in-person classroom activities. Therefore, in addition
to requesting schools to design and implement a DLP, state authorities have given
support to the decisions made by the schools rather than imposing any specific
practices for education continuity. Thus, we have witnessed a flexible governance
of schools, through the offer and availability of varied and appealing resources that,
while not being mandatory, gave space for effective proposals for solving problems.
Several implications arise from this study, which illustrate modes of state intervention in the government of education in the context of a health crisis. Thus, the
study allows us to realize that in situations like this, it is important: (1) to assure
the principle of equity, guaranteeing that students have access to the continuity of
classes remotely, with special attention to disadvantaged students, in order to mitigate the exposed inequalities in the context of a crisis; (2) for schools to have the

8 The Portuguese Educational Policy to Ensure Equity …

223

support and guidance of public authorities, whereas the government has a clear
orientation of the way forward to respond to problems caused at the system level by
crises such as COVID-19; (3) to empower schools and maintain a close relationship
between schools and families, via communicative tools, and through the creation
of local collaborative networks, involving various stakeholders in a logic of local
governance that, due to the proximity of problems, allows to respond more quickly
and more effectively to unforeseen events such as the pandemic; (4) to invest in
strategies that, whenever possible, involve interaction with students, thus allowing
to give feedback and monitor progress, in addition to contributing to the increase of
students’ motivation.
Finally, while not intended to be representative of the national context, this study
has made relevant contributions to the analysis of the referential (Muller, 2018)
that supported the emergency policy triggered during this phase of the pandemic in
Portugal. The interviews with teachers are illustrative of responses put into action
in their local contexts, in view of the laws and recommendations issued by the
government. In future research, it will be important to consider the influence of the
schooling year of students in the response given to the pandemic, as well as the
cultural and socioeconomic context in which schools are situated.

General Education in Russia During
COVID-19: Readiness, Policy Response,
and Lessons Learned
Sergey Kosaretsky, Sergey Zair-Bek, Yuliya Kersha, and Roman Zvyagintsev

Abstract In this chapter, we analyze nationwide measures taken in Russia to organize the education system during the pandemic. We show the opportunities and limitations for responses associated relative to the previous policy phase. Special attention
is paid to the peculiarities of a system reaction to the situation of a pandemic in a federative country with heterogeneous regions. In contrast to several other countries that
adopted a single national strategy, different scenarios were implemented in Russian
regions. We investigate the factors that influenced the scenarios and management
decisions at the national and regional levels of the country. We highlight differences in the nature and dynamics of measures taken to organize learning in the first
(spring–summer 2020) and second (autumn–winter 2020) waves of the pandemic.
We also analyze the subjective experience and wellbeing of students and teachers
during a pandemic. As the empirical base, we use data from several large sociological studies conducted in the Russian Federation over the past six months on the
issues of school closures, distance learning, and the “new normal.” This provides
a new perspective for studying the increasing education gap between children with
different socioeconomic status due to the pandemic.

9.1 Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic posed an unprecedented challenge to over 44,000 schools,
16.3 million students, and 2.16 million teachers in Russian schools (Ministry of
Education of the Russian Federation, 2020a). The government has had to solve
the complicated problem of providing constitutional guarantees of universal free
secondary general education while minimizing the immediate health risks for
students and teachers as well as the spread of infection through schools.
In this paper, we describe the situation in which the Russian education system
found itself during the COVID-19 pandemic and the education policy measures
adopted by the government at the federal and territorial levels. We examine the
contextual factors that influenced decision making and reflected the specifics of
the country’s territorial structure and education management system. We highlight
the differences between measures for ensuring the functioning of the education
system during the first and second waves of the pandemic and their dependence
on the epidemiological situation. Lastly, we discuss the impact and lessons learned
from the experience during the pandemic for student quality and wellbeing and the
future development of the education system (including policies aimed at families
and teachers, digitization, and management models).
The empirical section of the chapter focuses on the subjective wellbeing (SWB)
of Russian schoolchildren during the quarantine. We consider this topic to be especially important in the representation of the Russian case because: (1) the topic
of subjective wellbeing as a part of the educational process and results has been
traditionally ignored by Russian educational policy; (2) subjective wellbeing in the
Russian Federation is on average lower than the OECD average (OECD, n.d.); and
(3) in the context of a pandemic, subjective wellbeing may be a significantly more
important indicator of how well an education system is doing. In addition to a general
analysis of the factors associated with subjective wellbeing during school closures
for quarantine, we focus on inequality in subjective wellbeing—what happens to
children with different socioeconomic status? Against the background of increasing
inequality in educational outcomes amidst the pandemic, it is critical for us not to
overlook any possible widening gap in subjective wellbeing as this could be a much
more dangerous effect of the pandemic on the education system.

9.2 Methodology, Data, and Limitations
We use Russian federal statistics on education and related indicators, such as demographic and economic ones, to identify and describe the context of the education
policy. To analyze the administrative decisions adopted for mitigating the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, we drew upon open sources (official websites
of national, regional, and municipal government agencies, school websites, and

9 General Education in Russia During COVID-19 …

229

mass media) and interviews with different regional and municipal government officials (over 20 full-length online interviews through Skype). These interviews were
conducted by the Higher School of Economics Institute of Education during the
period March–October 2020. To assess the readiness of teachers, students, and families for distance learning, we used the results of international studies such as PISA
and TALIS (OECD, 2018). To study changes in teaching and learning practices, the
labor and living conditions of teachers and students, and the reaction of families to
the new study regime, we used the results of sociological surveys administered by
governmental and non-governmental organizations, including the School Barometer
International Study (Isaeva et al., 2020a).
The goal of the empirical part of the study was to identify and compare the level of
subjective wellbeing of Russian schoolchildren before school closures in the spring
of 2020 and at the present time (winter 2020). We use data from a study by the
HSE Institute of Education. The data was collected in November–December 2020.
To assess the situation before the first school closures in spring 2020, we employed
retrospective questions about the students’ state at that time.
The survey examined four Russian regions: Moscow, Kaliningrad, Leningrad,
and Tyumen Regions. The sample of education organizations within each region
was stratified by the type of locality (urban or rural) and the socioeconomic status of
the school (low, middle, high). The stratified random sample was selected among all
the schools of these regions with the help of information obtained during previous
studies on the quality of education (e.g., number of computers). The final sample of
the present study comprised 7,355 students between the ages of 8 and 19 (grades
4–11) from 99 Russian schools in the Moscow, Kaliningrad, Leningrad, and Tyumen
Regions.
The student questionnaires included questions about students’ main sociodemographic and economic characteristics (age, gender, parents’ higher education,
home possessions), their subjective wellbeing before the closure of schools and at the
present time (identical set of questions about the periods “before” and “after”), and
their ways of interacting with school during the absence of face-to-face education. In
addition to the students’ answers, the survey made use of school-level variables: share
of teachers with the higher qualification category; number of computers connected to
the internet per student; percent of students whose parents have a higher education;
and type of school area (urban or rural).
We based our questionnaire on a combination of instruments to assess the subjective wellbeing of schoolchildren: Holistic Student Assessment (Malti et al., 2018)
and assessment of students’ distress level (Goodman, 2009; Brann et al., 2018).
According to the theoretical framework, student subjective wellbeing includes several
components, of which the following were used in the present study: (1) orientation
on physical activity, (2) optimism, and (3) level of distress. We assume that these
components are especially important in the context of a pandemic when students may
suffer from anxiety and the lack of physical activity. To measure the level of each
component, the questionnaire presented 3–5 different statements with responses on
an ordinal scale. Some respondents who provided identical responses to all questions
were excluded from the analysis. Hierarchical confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)

230

S. Kosaretsky et al.

was used to calculate the overall indicator of subjective wellbeing. We tested a theoretical two-level model, where the first level measured the orientation on physical
activity, optimism, and stress level, while the second level measured subjective wellbeing. The results of our analysis confirmed the high quality of this model for two
cases: before and after the closure of schools (Appendix 1). The resulting values of
the subjective wellbeing score and its components before and after the closure of
schools were then used for the purpose of further analysis.
To compare the level of subjective wellbeing of the same students in the studied
regions before and after the closure of schools, we made a pairwise comparison
of indicators using the t-test for dependent samples. A similar methodology was
used to check if there were any differences in the change of subjective wellbeing
during the period of pandemic for students with different amounts of home possessions. Using descriptive analysis, we examine how students communicated with their
schools during the pandemic. The next step was to use multilevel modeling to assess
individual and school factors connected with student SWB before and after school
closures and with its variation over the period in question. To assess the changes
in subjective wellbeing, we subtracted the current value of the level of wellbeing
from its level before school closures. During the final stage, we used ANCOVA analysis to compare the mean indicators of subjective wellbeing in four regions while
controlling for significant relevant individual and school factors. The inclusion of
covariates in the analysis led to a better assessment of the differences connected
directly to regional factors rather than to the students’ family or school.

9.3 The Russian Education System in the Face
of the COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic
To understand the reaction of the Russian education system to the pandemic, we must
consider how education policy measures are discussed and implemented at the federal
and regional levels. First and foremost, Russia’s vast territory and heterogeneous
spatial development led to significant differences in both the infection rate and the
readiness to organize education activities during a pandemic throughout Russian
regions (Mau et al., 2020; World Bank, 2018).
Russian indicators of “computerization” and “connection of schools” to the
internet are above the OECD average (OECD, 2018). At the same time, the speed of
broadband internet connections is lower in Russia than the world average, amounting
to 45 Mbps. Only 76.9% of Russian households have access to the internet, and only
73.6% of them have access to broadband internet (Information Society in the Russian
Federation, 2020). A favorable situation exists in approximately 40% of Russian
regions as they have high indicators in both factors (availability of high-speed internet
and computer technologies).
Russian regions have different levels of urbanization. Some regions, especially
in Siberia and the Far East, have large numbers of small settlements with a poorly

9 General Education in Russia During COVID-19 …

231

developed digital infrastructure. School students living in these areas experienced the
greatest difficulties in distance learning. At the same time, the remoteness of villages
and the small size of schools were grounds for keeping schools open in those regions.
Difficulties with organizing distance learning disproportionally affected economically disadvantaged and multi-child families. About 4 million economically disadvantaged individuals in Russia are schoolchildren between the ages of 7 and 16.
Every sixth Russian inhabitant between the ages of 0 and 17 lives in a multi-child
family. The different distributions of these families across regions led to various difficulties in providing such children with computer technologies. The problems were
particularly acute in North Caucasian regions and several regions in Central Russia,
including the Moscow and Leningrad Regions. In contrast, the cities that formed the
nuclei of these regions (Moscow and Saint Petersburg) did not suffer from such difficulties. Different resource availabilities in cities and their surroundings contributed
to the growing inequality of school students during the pandemic.
In terms of distance learning infrastructure, different collections of digital
resources and the Russian Electronic School national distance learning platform
had been created at the federal level before the beginning of the pandemic. Some
regions had also set up their own digital platforms and services that could be used
for distance learning; the best-known example is the Moscow Electronic School. In
recent years, a market has emerged of private digital education resources and services
for both distance and blended learning. Contracts with various digital platforms have
been signed by separate regions, municipalities, and general education organizations,
giving them an advantage during the pandemic.
Another major factor was the federative structure of the state and the division of
responsibilities between federal executive agencies, regions, and municipalities that
hindered the implementation of a unified state strategy for the entire school system.
Most schools in Russia are managed by local municipal agencies. Free schooling
in Russia is financed by regional governments. The maintenance and renewal of
school property (buildings, equipment, etc.) is financed by local municipal agencies.
Federal education management agencies set the standards for education outcomes
and the conditions that must be met to attain them. The federal government also
sets the principal models for organizing the system’s work, including the assessment
of education quality, the professional development of teachers, the organization of
inclusive education, digitization, etc.
During the pandemic, this distribution of powers resulted in the following situation: the Federal Ministry of Education established the general principles for
education organizations (banned mass events, created norms of social distancing,
etc.), implemented national measures (launched digital platforms with learning and
teaching materials, organized televised lessons), changed the dates and form of the
state final certification, and monitored measures taken at the territorial level. At the
same time, decisions on extending vacations, closing/opening schools, and classes,
fixing the end of the school year and other organizational matters were made at
the regional and municipal levels. Regions and municipalities were responsible for
assuring the digital infrastructure such as the availability and quality of internet access
as well as the provision of PCs and laptops to teachers and students. It frequently

232

S. Kosaretsky et al.

turned out that the regions with the least financial resources for solving these problems
were the same regions with the greatest needs.
In addition to the distribution of managerial powers, there is relevant background
of relations between federal and regional government agencies. Over the past 5 years,
the Federal Ministry of Education has de facto centralized decision making and
limited the autonomy of regions in choosing the subjects and development models of
general education. For this reason, after the pandemic began, many regions waited for
instructions from the federal ministry. Nevertheless, the latter stressed the rights and
responsibilities of regions in deciding which measures should be taken in response
to the pandemic. This was quite unexpected for some regions.

9.4 Education Policy at Different Levels During
the COVID-19 Pandemic: General Trends
The first cases of COVID-19 were recorded in Russia in February 2020. The disease
began to spread in early March 2020. The development of the epidemic corresponded
to the widespread international model of two disease waves and peaks. The first peak
of the epidemic (11,656 new cases daily) occurred in early May 2020. The incidence
of the disease subsequently fell until September 2020. This was followed by the
second wave of the pandemic between September and December 2020 with a peak
(29,935 new cases daily) before the beginning of the winter holidays and school
vacation.
The strategy of the Russian education system differed considerably between the
two waves of the pandemic. During the first wave, a nationwide lockdown was introduced for all intents and purposes, and most schools switched to distance education.
During the second wave, the restrictions greatly differed from region to region, and
most schools remained open.
Moreover, as our study shows, school closures during the quarantine had little to
do with the real incidence rate of the disease (see Fig. 9.1a,b). Due to the limited
access to data on the incidence rate of the disease among children and on the impact
of school closures on disease incidence, the decisions to close schools for quarantine
or switch to distance study were made based on general federal policy.
First wave
After the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing enacted rules for the
organization of educational activities after the quarantine, including cancelling mass
events, dividing classes (to limit contact), implementing disinfection measures, and
introducing special measures during the state final certification.
The Russian Ministry of Education initiated and/or supported the following key
organizational and technological solutions:

Providing schoolchildren from particularly disadvantaged families with
computers for distance learning

The Russian Ministry of Education allowed regions to make their own decisions
based on the local epidemiological situation about the partial premature termination
of the school year and about extending school vacations and changing quarantine
regimes. The Russian Ministry of Education also introduced several distance learning
platforms from which regions could choose.
Nevertheless, these support measures did not work immediately. Each region had
to make its own choice based on different factors. In some cases, regional education
management agencies announced the early termination of certain (non-core) classes
for students in grades 1–8. This led to the reduction of study loads and internet traffic.
This took place in some Siberian regions and regions along the Volga River.
Several regions signed special agreements with internet providers for delivering
internet services at reduced rates or free of charge and using secondary regional
resources for distance learning needs. They also signed agreements with mobile
network operators for lower internet rates and special packages for teachers and
students. Some regions also used various other mechanisms such as creating mirror
sites and hosting education resources. In some regions, internet providers offered
internet traffic for distance learning at low rates or virtually free of charge to economically disadvantaged families. Several private online platforms (Yandex Textbook,
Uchi.ru) provided free content to support schoolchildren and prevent academic lag.
The lack of computers in families for organizing distance study was compensated
by different regions in various ways. In some areas (such as the Moscow Region),
school notebooks were offered to families. Other regions (such as the Republic of
Sakha-Yakutia) bought computers to offer them to families. In Saint Petersburg and
other regions, computers for families were bought with the help of sponsors. Finally,
as we mentioned above, the federal government launched a fundraising campaign
for purchasing computers for families in need.
To help teachers organize the study process from home, some regions offered
school computers to teachers and provided them with technical assistance in configuring home computers and connecting them to the internet. The federal government implemented the project “Education Volunteers,” in which senior students from
teaching colleges helped teachers who were unfamiliar with computer technologies
to master the basics of organizing distance learning.
In many regions, education development institutes and municipal curricular offices
helped teachers by offering express courses and consultations on working in the
new format, recorded video guides and training webinars, opened tutor centers, and
organized consulting by curricular association directors and teachers who had won
professional competitions. Other regional initiatives catered to parents. Hotlines were
setup to consult and assist both parents and children using the new distance learning
format. These hotlines were staffed by specialists from education management agencies, education psychologists, school counselors, and teachers. In different regions,
schools provided support for low-income families distributing food products and
even ready meals.

9 General Education in Russia During COVID-19 …

235

The regions that were the best-positioned to deal with COVID-19 had prior experience in organizing distance learning in bad weather conditions. In these regions,
online study was quickly and efficiently deployed, while teachers were much better
prepared for the distance learning format. The same was true of individual education organizations that had already begun to develop digital environments before
the pandemic, actively used electronic agendas, maintained up-do-date sites stocked
with different content, and participated in social media groups. All these instruments
were easily adapted to serve the needs of distance learning.
As the first wave of the pandemic showed, distance learning was best organized in
territories in which regional and local management teams took the initiative without
waiting for directions from federal education management agencies.
All schools in Moscow and the Moscow Region were given the opportunity to
work on a high-quality platform with a full range of content. The Republic of Tatarstan
invited its schools to use several different education platforms simultaneously for
different subjects and grades. At the same time, internet access was almost completely
lacking in rural schools in several South Siberian regions, forcing teachers to bring
homework assignments to collection points (such as village stores), from where they
were gathered by parents and students. Some regions in the Far East, South Siberia,
and Far North organized education with the help of televised educational programs.
No analytic or preparatory work for the new school year was conducted during the
summer holidays (June–August). No nationwide programs for improving the availability and quality of internet access and computer technologies were implemented,
either.
During the first wave of the pandemic in the spring, many parents, teachers, and
education managers at different levels believed that the pandemic was a temporary
emergency that would soon end without requiring the education system to make any
major changes. Some parents, teachers, and students did not believe in COVID-19
or considered its danger to be greatly exaggerated. The skeptical attitude of some
teachers, parents, and schoolchildren to the risks and dangers of the pandemic, especially during the first wave in the spring, as well as the belief that the quarantine
would not last long led to a certain inertia and reactionism of managerial decisions.
Interviews with officials of regional and municipal education management agencies have shown that the uncertainty and lack of clear forecasts about the development
of the pandemic, especially during its initial period, led regions and schools to take
quick short-term measures. These measures had small time horizons and were based
on the expectation of a rapid return to the usual format of face-to-face learning. The
distance learning format was viewed as a temporary emergency measure that did
not require any major investments of resources. In addition, the tendency to downplay the pandemic and its consequences for schools was also linked to the lack of
clear and unambiguous instructions from the federal government by the respondents.
The freedom allotted to regional, municipal, and school managers to take their own
decisions was often interpreted as a sign that the federal government did not know
what to do in the circumstances. On the other hand, the lack of control from above
was seen as an opportunity to avoid “awkward” measures that could irritate parents,
teachers, and students.

236

S. Kosaretsky et al.

Due to the increased loads during the distance learning period and the prolongation
of the school year, teachers were given an additional leave before the start of the new
school year. Most teachers, parents, and students expected the school year to start in
the traditional place-based format. Regions partially implemented local preparatory
measures for preparing schools for the school year: renovating and re-equipping
buildings, providing high-speed internet access, and training teachers.
Second wave
In October, it became clear that the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic had
already begun in Russia. Federal government agencies had not issued any teaching or
organizational recommendations by the beginning of the second wave, stressing that
regions should make all managerial decisions on their own. Only in early October
did the Russian Ministry of Education elaborate and publish recommendations on
amending study programs in view of the coronavirus infection and recommendations
on using information technologies (Ministry of Education of the Russian Federation,
2020c, d). The Ministry published practical recommendations on organizing the work
of teachers in the distance learning format only in November (Ministry of Education
of the Russian Federation, 2020b). In these conditions, regions continued to provide
curricular support to schools and train teachers on their own.
The second wave was a lot more extensive and serious than the first. The prevalence
and incidence rate of the disease increased. Nevertheless, this situation did not lead
to the mass transition of the education system to the distance learning format, as had
been the case during the first wave (Fig. 9.2).
In October–November 2020, 55 regions kept schools in the place-based format
(with isolated transitions to quarantine regimes and distance learning when the
minimum prevalence rate of the disease was surpassed), while 30 regions made a
partial transition to the distance learning format. While different regions put different
grades into distance learning, almost none of them applied this measure to primary
schools; the mass distance learning format also did not affect schools with small
student bodies, as a rule. 70% of schoolchildren continued to study in the placebased format in October–November. Only 0.1% of all schools were closed entirely
for quarantine.1
By late December, the total number of closed schools had decreased, even though
the incidence rate of the disease continued to grow. Only 64 schools in 20 regions
were still closed (0.16% of all schools) in late December (Fig. 9.3).
At the same time, some regions with high incidence rates did not adopt distance
learning. 37 regions did not extend the fall break, while 48 regions extended the
fall break by 1–3 weeks. Vacation prolongation was the most widespread antipandemic measure in Russian regions (a prolongation of 2 weeks in 40 regions and
3 weeks in 8 regions). Once again, many regions with high incidence rates refused to
prolong school vacation, and only 39% of regions with high incidence rates converted

Fig. 9.2 Distribution of place-based and distance learning formats in the Russian Federation in
October–November 2020 (Mertsalova et al., 2021)

schools to distance learning. Moreover, regions with similar conditions sometimes
took different decisions. For example, Moscow put middle and high school students
on distance learning, while Saint Petersburg retained place-based education for all
schoolchildren, even though the incidence rates and risks of infection in Saint Petersburg were no lower than in Moscow. In some cases, parental protests over distance
learning along with electoral worries discouraged government officials from making
changes. Parental anxieties grew despite repeated assurances that distance learning
would not be introduced under any circumstances (Kommersant, 2020). Thus, antipandemic measures during the second wave were chosen more based on social and
political factors than objective assessments of the risks.
An important role was played by political signals from the federal center based
on fears of aggravating social and economic problems due to the pandemic. Another
major factor was growing popular discontent. Parents’ tensions and mistrust of the
distance learning format grew as the pandemic progressed. A survey conducted in
mid-April showed that 63% of parents believed that schools had successfully shifted
to distance learning, while 17% of parents disagreed (Public Opinion Foundation,
2020). In a survey in May, 55% of surveyed parents of final-year students expressed
their discontent with the organization of distance learning (Rambler News Service,
2020). By the start of the following school year, 93% of parents believed that study
should be implemented in a place-based format. This was motivated by the assertion

238

S. Kosaretsky et al.

Fig. 9.3 Prolongation of fall break in Russian regions (Mertsalova et al., 2021)

that face-to-face study allows children to communicate and socialize (30%) and leads
to better education quality (20%), better knowledge (17%) and direct contacts with
teachers (16%); in addition, parents believe that they cannot educate their children as
well as teachers (14%) (Russian Public Opinion Research Center, 2020). Some mass
media even launched an information campaign claiming that the government was
planning to abandon place-based education altogether after the end of the pandemic.

9.5 Consequences and Lessons of the Coronavirus
Pandemic
The experience of transforming the general education system in Russia in the conditions of the pandemic has produced important consequences and lessons for the
development of Russian education both today and in the future. Russian experts agree
that the reorganization of education during the pandemic, especially during the first
wave, led to losses in the quality of education on account of changes in the employed
technologies and the reduction in study time (due to prolonged vacations as well as
schools and classes put in quarantine). With regards to technology, distance learning
is not yet fully able to replace face-to-face learning, according to most teachers,

9 General Education in Russia During COVID-19 …

239

parents, and students. Many distance lessons have suffered from poor quality, simplified content, and the lack of interactivity and feedback. The reduction in study time
depended on the school and the subject. Subjects calling for student participation
(physical education, art, music, technology, etc.) were particularly affected.
At the same time, the national system for education quality assessment does not
provide open data about education losses, as we have already mentioned. According
to World Bank forecasts, Russian schoolchildren will lose about 16 points on the
PISA reading score or 1/3–1/2 year of study on average (World Bank Group, 2020).
The Ministry of Education postponed the annual national tests (taken by all school
students simultaneously and in the same format) from April to the beginning of the
school year to serve as “initial assessments that would be used to correct the study
process” (RG, 2020).
The very idea of conducting a monitoring and diagnostic study of the readiness
of students for the new school year and their academic lag due to the extraordinary
study circumstances in March–May 2020 was considered very important for both
theoretical and practical reasons. The large sample (6 million people) could have
been used to identify typical problems and difficulties faced by students and elaborate
recommendations for teachers on the format of curricular materials for place-based
and distance learning formats. The analysis of the identified problems could have also
served as a guideline for private producers of educational content, including designers
of digital platforms. However, no analysis of the sort was conducted, and the results
were neither discussed by the expert and teacher communities nor used as sources
for planning teacher retraining courses and the work of education psychologists.
The Ministry’s methodological recommendations invited schools and teachers to
analyze the results of the national tests themselves and to submit within two weeks
a proposed scheduled of working with students experiencing academic problems
(Ministry of Education of the Russian Federation, 2020e). Thus, the national tests
led to an additional workload being put on teachers in the absence of all informational
and curricular support from the federal government.
During the first semester of the new school year, no national measures (extra
classes, prolonged school year, vacation programs, etc.) were taken to compensate for
losses in education quality that affect student trajectories and labor market prospects,
despite recommendations by international organizations (UNESCO, 2020). Our analysis shows that few regions and schools implemented such measures at their own
initiative. The introduction of such measures aimed both at students completing
school during the current year as well as planning to enter vocational colleges and
universities and at the entire student body that has been adversely affected by the
pandemic remains a key yet open item on the agenda.
Another major negative consequence is the deterioration of the subjective wellbeing and psychological health of students because of the adverse impact of living
conditions during the pandemic (including the lack of social interaction, face-toface communication between children, and communication between children and
adults during mutual activities; strained family relations; reduced physical activity;
and significantly reduced external support for study). 78% of surveyed parents spoke
about the growing discomfort of their children due to the lack of communication with

240

S. Kosaretsky et al.

peers, noting that this is a very important function of school. Only half of surveyed
parents (49.3%) said that teachers interacted with pupils in the distance learning
format and organized direct communication. A similar share (49.6%) noted that
teachers provided feedback to students about study and assessment results (Isaeva
et al., 2020a). Psychological problems resulting from self-isolation and distance
learning were found among 83.8% of Russian schoolchildren: 42.2% purportedly
suffered from depression and 41.6% from asthenia (TASS, 2020).
In the context of the data already available, we decided to conduct a separate
study. We were less interested in the absolute picture of the subjective wellbeing
of schoolchildren than in whether the patterns of changes differ for children with
different SES. Additionally, we looked for indirect evidence of whether schools
“lose” children during quarantine by examining the characteristics and frequency of
interaction between the school and the child.
Subjective wellbeing and psychological health of students
Researchers now predominantly ignore such topics, focusing instead on the analysis
of objective losses in the quality of learning due to digital inequality (Engzell et al.,
2020; Robinson et al., 2020; Van Lancker & Parolin, 2020). They disregard the
theme of subjective wellbeing, although psycho-emotional problems due to school
closures, lack of traditional summer vacations, illnesses of close relatives, and an
uncertain future may have an even bigger impact on students (Ghosh et al., 2020).
At the same time, certain international monitoring studies (OECD, 2017) assess
subjective satisfaction with life. Promoting subjective wellbeing is the third of the
17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations, 2020). This is particularly
relevant during worldwide pandemics such as COVID-19. In the present study, we
analyze contextual factors at the school and individual levels related to different SWB
trends of Russian school students during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The notion of wellbeing is understood in different ways depending on the context.
However, it is clear that wellbeing is a complex notion that cannot be measured by a
single indicator (Borgonovi & Pál, 2016). Wellbeing studies traditionally examine all
participants of the educational process—children (Yu et al., 2018), parents (Buehler,
2006), teachers (Mccallum et al., 2017)—and the connections between them (Casas
et al., 2012; McCallum & Price, 2010). In the OECD framework, wellbeing comprises
11 indicators, including personal security and social connections (OECD, 2017). In
this paper, we focus only on subjective wellbeing, ignoring other dimensions such as
health. We define wellbeing as “the assessments, whether positive or negative, that
people make of their own lives” (Diener, 2006).
Many organizations, besides OECD, make international comparative studies about
the contextual factors that determine the subjective wellbeing of school students.
For example, a study by Korean scholars shows that subjective wellbeing is best
predicted by variables from the micro level of children’s life (family, school and close
community), while economic and broader national contextual factors are less or not
at all significant (Lee & Yoo, 2015). However, another study shows that national
factors are, on the contrary, quite important: the better the public health, material
wellbeing, and education system in a country, the higher the children’s subjective

9 General Education in Russia During COVID-19 …

241

wellbeing (Bradshaw et al., 2013). At the same time, the comparison of rural and
urban territories within a single country traditionally shows that rural children have
a higher level of subjective wellbeing (Gross-Manos & Shimoni, 2020; Rees et al.,
2017). Nevertheless, this trend may only apply to countries with a sufficiently high
overall standard of living in rural areas (Requena, 2016).
Regarding studies of the impact of inequality (whether economic or territorial)
on the subjective wellbeing of children, a survey of 15 different countries in Europe,
Asia, and Africa demonstrated a positive connection with a child’s home possessions yet no connection with economic inequality indicators at the national level
(Main et al., 2019). Studies of so-called “rich societies” paint a different picture: the
wellbeing of children at the national level is connected with the level of economic
inequality in a country yet not with the mean wage (Pickett & Wilkinson, 2007). At
the same time, other studies show that the lower the general socioeconomic level
of the neighborhood in which children grow up, the lower their subjective wellbeing (Laurence, 2019). However, this paper indicates that there is no direct connection here: disadvantaged communities have more negative and fewer positive social
interactions, which results in lower wellbeing (Ibid.).
Researchers from Yale University and Columbia Business School show that the
higher the income inequality in a country, the higher the level of subjective wellbeing.
Although this does not directly apply to children, it is an important consideration
since the authors conduct an extensive analysis of the contradictory nature of statistics
in this field (Katic & Ingram, 2017). Objective aspects of wellbeing are unequally
distributed by gender, age, class, and ethnicity and are strongly associated with
life satisfaction (Western & Tomaszewski, 2016). Although there are relatively few
studies of the effect of specific factors on subjective wellbeing, especially in the case
of children, we attempt to do so in this study. There are many studies on the relation
between subjective wellbeing and age, which show that most developed countries
have U-shaped SWB curves with a minimum at the age of 40–50 (Steptoe et al.,
2015). At the same time, the objective and subjective SES of people is connected to
changes to the SWB in at least a 4-year perspective (Zhao et al., 2021).
In the present study, we examine the existence of similar trends for children over a
short-term period. Clearly, a country’s social policies are important in the long term:
children are happier if they live in favorable conditions and safe communities, attend
good schools, etc. (Bradshaw, 2015). However, we cannot examine such policies
here. Instead, we look at the impact of certain factors “here and now” rather than in
the long term.
One example of the questions that were included in the survey as a component of
wellbeing scale is the statement: “There are more good than bad things in my life.”
Respondents were asked to agree or disagree with this claim. It can be seen from
Table 9.1 that the distribution of answers for the period before school closures differs
from answers about the current situation. We can see a widening pattern for opposite
categories, which is also true for the SWB index as a whole.
A comparison of the level of subjective wellbeing of students before the closure
of schools in the spring and at the present time shows that this indicator fell on
average in most of the studied regions (Fig. 9.4). Significant decreases in the level of

wellbeing were observed in the Kaliningrad Region (t = 3.14, p = 0.001), Leningrad
Region (t = 1.76, p = 0.039) and Moscow Region (t = 1.65, p = 0.050). The latter
experienced the greatest decrease. At the same time, the wellbeing of children in the
Tyumen Region increased slightly over this period, although this increase was not
significant (t = -1.58, p = 0.943).
Assessment of the change in wellbeing during the pandemic for groups of students
with different amount of home possessions reveals alarming results. We found that
in the group of students with comparatively low level of home possessions there was
a significant decrease in wellbeing during the pandemic (t = 2.42, p = 0.016). On the
other hand, students from families with middle and high levels of home possessions
did not experience any significant changes in subjective wellbeing. This illustrates
growing inequality between students from different families in the period of school
closures (Fig. 9.5).
Among all other socio-demographic characteristics, only student age was significantly related to a change in wellbeing in the pandemic period. Younger students aged
8–10 years claimed a slight increase in subjective wellbeing after school closures (t
= -5.27, p = 0.000). At the same time, students from 11 to 14 years old had significantly lower results on the subjective wellbeing scale after school closures (t = 3.34,
p = 0.001 and t = 2.98, p = 0.003). In addition, no significant changes in subjective
wellbeing were found for students aged 15 years and older (Fig. 9.6).

As for communication with school, it appears that about 11% of all students
lost almost all contact with their schools. Only 89% of respondents stated that they
received messages from school almost every day. Other students received messages
from school once a week or even less. Of all the means of communication with
students, schools used emails most often (84%). In addition, 32% of students claimed
that they communicated with school by video calls (Fig. 9.7).
Our study of factors contributing to student subjective wellbeing showed that
school characteristics did not play a key role in the state of children. No school characteristic (school resources, student body, area) had a significant connection with the
subjective wellbeing of students if individual and regional factors were included in
the model. Significant individual characteristics both before and after school closures

included gender, age, parents’ higher education, and home possessions (e.g., car, television, computer, air conditioner, etc.) (Fig. 9.8).2 Girls had a lower level of subjective
wellbeing than boys; the same was true for older students in comparison to younger.
At the same time, the parents’ education and the number of home possessions had a
positive relationship with the subjective wellbeing. The region in which the student
lives also had an effect: the subjective wellbeing of students in the Tyumen Region
was higher than in other regions both before school closures and in the winter of
2020.

3 The change was measured as SWB before school closure minus SWB after school closure.

Our analysis confirms the results of prior SWB studies. In particular, our findings
that primary school students had higher subjective wellbeing than older students
before and after school closures, while boys sustainably felt better than girls, are
consistent with recent major studies of student subjective wellbeing (Lampropoulou,
2018).
Measurements of the level of SWB since the closure of schools show that
subjective wellbeing had fallen less for students with numerous home possessions
(Fig. 9.9).4 Another important factor is student interaction with schools during the
absence of face-to-face learning: students who received information from their school
by email or through online platforms showed a more stable level of subjective wellbeing. At the same time, the older the student, the more his or her subjective wellbeing decreased over the period in question. With regards to regional differences, the
greatest changes in SWB were observed in the Kaliningrad and Moscow Regions
while the least changes were observed in the Tyumen Region.
Finally, we made a comparative analysis of the level of student subjective wellbeing in 4 regions after school closures while controlling significant individual factors
of wellbeing (gender, age, parents’ education, home possessions) as well as the
level of subjective wellbeing before school closures (Fig. 9.10). The inclusion of
covariates into the analysis helped to identify differences that arose between regions
during the absence of face-to-face learning and that were not connected with the

246

individual characteristics of student families and their level of subjective wellbeing
before school closures. Our analysis showed that a significantly high level of wellbeing was observed in the Tyumen Region during the period of the survey. Other
regions had a lower (and roughly similar) level of student subjective wellbeing (with
corrections for student individual characteristics).
Can schools help to overcome the instability of subjective wellbeing during
distance learning? Our analysis shows that they do have some levers at their disposal.
The use of online platforms by schools to communicate with students studying at a
distance is correlated with higher SWB stability during the pandemic. This measure is
simple to implement. At the state level, one must elaborate commonly accepted protocols for the interaction between schools and students during emergency situations
such as the COVID-19 pandemic. There is also a need for programs for developing
social skills and skills for coping with emotions. In the context of current problems
and difficulties, such programs are particularly urgent (during both school closures
and the return to “normal” life) (Lampropoulou, 2018).
Looking at the broader research and policy context, it would also be important to
study the impact of national factors on student subjective wellbeing. Another area
is quasi-experimental studies of the connection between the wellbeing of adults and
the wellbeing (or even the presence) of children. It has been shown already that the
pandemic has had, on average, a negative impact on the SWB of all families and that,
moreover, these effects differ for families with and without children (Möhring et al.,
2020).

9.6 Discussion and Conclusions
The pandemic in Russia has highlighted the problem of the digital gap and, more
broadly, educational poverty—the set of differences between children’s study conditions connected with their family’s place of residence (internet access, quality of
telecommunications), material status (computer, workplace, ability to pay for internet
and telecommunications), cultural capital, and involvement in education (ability to
offer assistance). Children from low-income and multi-child families were the most
affected.
While inequality is one of the main issues on the international agenda of education
research and policy, it has been largely neglected by the Russian government over
the years. The pandemic has opened the eyes of politicians and society to what they
had mostly overlooked in the past: differences between children in the conditions of
study connected to the family place of residence, cultural capital, and involvement in
education. This connection has become more apparent during the pandemic than in
“normal” conditions, leading to a more widespread understanding of the existence
and impact of such inequalities on “normal” life. As it turned out, the education
system did not know whom it was working with in particular, it disposed of no
information or data on student and family categories that would allow it to identify and
support groups at risk quickly. Whereas countries such as Australia, New Zealand,
and the USA allowed children who could not get the proper care and supervision
at home to continue to attend school, Russia did not have any initiatives remotely
similar.
Several studies have already shown that the pandemic has broadened the knowledge gap between children with different socioeconomic statuses (SES) (Engzell
et al., 2020). Our study demonstrates that the same thing is happening with respect
to SWB during school closures. Students from low-SES families not only had lower
level of SWB before school closures, but also experienced a significant decline
during quarantine. This indicates that children with fewer home possessions have
been more affected by the pandemic in comparison to their more advantaged peers.
Policymakers may think that this problem can be simply solved by allocating distance
learning technologies to children from disadvantaged families. Nevertheless, these
mechanisms are a lot more complex, and the problem cannot be simply solved by
distributing laptops (as California did during the transition to online learning) (Bravo,
2020).
While some measures were implemented for equalizing education opportunities
during the pandemic, they were far from exhaustive. It is important that the interests
of disadvantaged students and schools remain at the center of attention of federal and
regional governments. Building a system for identifying and supporting children at
risk of academic failure (including extra financing for schools where such children
study, target work with families, remedial education programs, etc.) is vital for the
future of Russian general education.
The pandemic has also highlighted the role of parents in education. The introduction of a lockdown in April led many parents to work online at home as well as to help

248

S. Kosaretsky et al.

their children to study. Many parents were ill prepared for this challenge. The School
Barometer survey asked parents, “How well did you manage to combine work, your
children’s studies, and ordinary life while staying at home during self-isolation?” The
mean response amounted to 3.6 points (on a 10-point scale with 1 corresponding to
“very poorly” and 10 to “very well”) (Isaeva et al., 2020b). Domestic conflicts flared
out, and fatigue and psychological discomfort grew. As a result, parents began to
protest about the distance learning format during the pandemic and its use in the
future.
At the same time, during the distance learning period some parents (especially
from the urban middle class and above) saw the need to take a more conscientious
attitude to their children’s education and choice of study trajectories by hiring tutors
and selecting online platforms; they are planning to do so in the future, too. The experience of the pandemic also showed that school is not the only place where education
can take place, and that distance learning has clear advantages in certain areas (such as
allowing individuals to study and have greater opportunities for independent work).
This has motivated many families to switch to home education.
The difficult interactions between parents and schools, their mutual distrust, and
their attempts to put the blame and responsibility on each other were important
lessons of the pandemic. Russian general education clearly needs a new model of
interaction between schools and parents with a distribution of responsibilities and
mechanisms of mutual assistance and parent education.
During the pandemic, radical changes occurred in the work of teachers and their
relations with other education stakeholders. The load on teachers greatly increased
during the distance learning period due to the need to master online resources
and tools, make additional preparations for class, consult students and parents, etc.
The existing model of regulating labor relations also showed limitations, in particular, in such aspects as overtime work, wages (including compensating the costs of
employing one’s own equipment and using outside services), and salary incentives.
At the same time, no teacher protests coordinated by labor unions took place in
Russia in contrast to other countries. Russian schools need a new type of contract
with teachers that would combine modern standards for professional competences
and optimal working conditions.
The experience of transforming general education during the pandemic was also
highly informative for the education management system. The pandemic made it
clear that the federal government did not dispose of sufficient levers to assure equal
opportunities of full-fledged schooling in all Russian regions. There were useful
regulatory and curricular documents, recommendations, and initiatives at the federal
level. Nevertheless, problems were mostly solved at the regional and municipal levels,
which differed in their available resources, management potential, and accumulated
experience.
The lack of a pro-active stance in most Russian regions, municipalities, and
schools with regards to anti-coronavirus disease measures is an evident problem of
Russian education. In some regions, education managers took a more active stance by
looking for new solutions. Nevertheless, most of them began to go beyond traditional
measures and offered creative solutions only after understanding that the pandemic

9 General Education in Russia During COVID-19 …

249

would continue for a long time. It was only then that they stated that the distance
learning format would remain in effect until the end of the school year.
Far from simply implementing federal initiatives and meeting preset indicators of
effectiveness, successful regions took individual approaches and launched their own
initiatives in which education was embedded into socioeconomic policy. Regions
with less initiative that managed education on a day-by-day basis without a global
strategy, simply reacting to federal initiatives, were much worse off. The interaction
between different levels of education management during the pandemic shows that
regions with a lot of initiative should be given extensive freedom in the use of
federal resources for digitization. Instead of trying to control all processes, the federal
government should let regions, municipalities, and schools take the initiative and
build their own horizontal ties. Unified solutions should be implemented with the
help of a mechanism of target support aimed at reducing interregional differentiation.
Another major new international trend of education management is to base
managerial decisions on a broad range of educational and contextual data, including
data that has not been used up until now. This data comes from the domains of healthcare, culture, finances, and demographics. The publication and analysis of such data
has led to the emergence of a new field that may be called “evidence-based education,” which is analogous to the field of evidence-based medicine. Some management
models (e.g., the model of online extracurricular education) can be implemented only
after analyzing certain indicators and sets of indicators. Unfortunately, no such transition has occurred in Russian education so far. In contrast to many other countries,
Russia has published no open statistics about the incidence rate of the pandemic
among school-age children that could serve as guidelines for converting schools to
distance learning, nor has it conducted detailed studies of losses in education quality.
Decisions on organizing the work of the education system in the conditions of
the COVID-19 pandemic were made in conditions of considerable uncertainty about
the nature of the disease, the magnitude of the risks, and the role of schools and
students in spreading the infection as well as about the impact of school closures
on the quality of education and the wellbeing of children. Our analysis shows that
this uncertainty existed in Russia both during the initial stage of the pandemic and
during the period between the first and second waves. Its impact on losses in education
quality and student wellbeing has yet to be determined. Nevertheless, a key lesson of
the pandemic is that one must learn to plan in the conditions of continued uncertainty
to implement both education response and education recovery measures. One must
keep track of the growing experience in this domain in the country and the world
particularly with regards to the effectiveness of education response and education
recovery in Russian regions and other countries.
Building an evidence-based education management system for effectively
responding to the challenges of the current pandemic and possible similar challenges in the future with the help of digital instruments should become a national
priority. This would greatly simplify the work of schools in the event of a new wave
of COVID-19 as well as solving the problems that flared out in 2020 before they
become endemic.

Science, Social Responsibility,
and Education: The Experience
of Singapore During the COVID-19
Pandemic
Oon Seng Tan and Jallene Jia En Chua
Abstract In this chapter we first outline how the pandemic unfolded before highlighting the key thinking and strategies Singapore adopted in policy responses
towards the crisis. The two key principles of Singapore’s approach, science, and
social responsibility, contributed greatly to its success in handling the public health
crisis. This chapter will elaborate on these principles and examine how these policies
were carried out in the educational realm. We look at how Singapore relied on its
strengths of proactive rational planning and execution to facilitate the transition to
home-based learning (HBL) and the subsequent re-opening of schools. Concomitant with policies to address health and well-being for all students were strategies to
ensure continuity of learning, student engagement, and innovation in the new learning
environment. The use of online learning portals such as the Student Learning Space
enabled all students from primary to pre-university levels to have equal access to
quality curriculum resources. Professional development and preparation of teachers
pertaining to facilitating new modes of learning were as important as implementation
measures. Given the unexpected impact of the pandemic and the need for scalability
there were also many challenges to ensure equitable access and holistic well-being
for vulnerable groups of students. Looking forward, we discuss the implications of
the pandemic on Singapore’s education scene, such as how it elevated core issues
related to curriculum, pedagogy, and design of learning environments. We talk about
opportunities for some of these issues to be addressed in policy and research, and
how doing so can better build an adaptable education system for the twenty-first
century.

10.1 Introduction
Singapore is a small island nation with an estimated population of 5.7 million people.
Being a small country, it is governed by a central government and thus policies and
measures are often applied consistently nationwide. As a combination of a public
health crisis, an economic recession, and a prolonged period of social isolation
(Golberstein et al., 2020), the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on Singapore’s
economy, disrupted many Singaporeans from their regular routines, and brought
about physical, mental, and financial challenges for many. However, Singapore’s
policy response to the crisis has been noteworthy, and widely lauded to have been
prompt and resilient, yet flexible. By January 2021, Singapore had announced the
implementation of Phase 3 (Ministry of Health, 2020), the third and last phase of
the reopening of Singapore’s businesses and public spaces ever since the country
exited its lockdown phase in June 2020. In this chapter, we discuss the key principles of Singapore’s policy response to the crisis highlighting science and social
responsibility, and further examine how these principles were applied to policies in
the educational context. We then discuss challenges, implications for the education
system, and opportunities for research and policy.

10.2 Unfolding of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Singapore
This section provides some context of the COVID-19 pandemic timeline unfolding
in Singapore in 2020 (see Fig. 10.1). Singapore’s first imported COVID-19 case
(a 66-year-old Chinese national) was reported on January 23, 2020, followed by a
couple more imported cases in the following days. At this point in time, locals went
about their daily lives as per usual, with little concern of the threat of the virus as
there was still no evidence of transmission within the local community. Only after
local transmission was first reported on February 3 did the COVID-19 pandemic
start to reach national attention in Singapore. On February 7, Singapore raised its
national risk assessment level, known as the Disease Outbreak Response System
Condition (DORSCON) level, from “yellow” to “orange” to alert of the possibility of
a local pandemic. This led to heightened public awareness of the virus, and triggered
reactions of fear such as panic buying at supermarkets to stock up on necessities. In
late March, many Singaporeans abroad returned home, causing a spike in imported
cases. This was followed by a massive outbreak in foreign workers’ dormitories and
a fast-increasing number of new and unlinked community cases. In response to this,
the Singapore government carried out a stringent set of lockdown measures from
April 7 to May 4, officially known as the “circuit breaker”. The circuit breaker was
subsequently extended for another four weeks to June 1. During the circuit breaker,
all schools and non-essential workplaces were closed, and all gatherings with family
or friends who did not live together were banned.

After the circuit breaker, Singapore slowly moved towards reopening of workplaces, schools, and businesses via three phases. Phase 1 of reopening lasted for
about three weeks, where some activities beyond the essential services were allowed
to resume progressively (e.g., hairdressing services beyond haircuts, bookshops, and
motor vehicle servicing). Phase 2 lasted for about 6 months and allowed for dining
in with a 5-person limit, as well as the reopening of other services like retail. On
December 28, Singapore transitioned into its third and final phase of reopening,
increasing the public gathering and home visiting limit from 5 people to 8. The
government also introduced free vaccinations for all Singaporeans and long-term
residents.

10.3 Operating on Science and Government-Wide
Approach
Taking a government-wide approach entails different ministries coming together to
achieve policy coherence and synergy. Using such an approach, Singapore’s priorities during the crisis were to protect the lives of all citizens and to ensure economic
livelihood and future readiness. Singapore’s stance and approach towards handling
the COVID-19 pandemic have been based on two key principles: science and social
responsibility. First, management of the crisis was driven by science, where implementation of any policies and measures was informed by data and scientific evidence.
For example, the science of infectious diseases tells us about the danger of virus noncontainment, where cases can increase at an exponential rate if uncontrolled. Thus,
from the beginning, Singapore prioritized the health and safety of its citizens by
being proactive and decisive with rolling out containment measures. As early as the
start of January 2020, when news of the virus outbreak in Wuhan were first reported,
Singapore had already begun screening measures at Changi Airport for incoming
travelers from the region and issued health advisories for the general public. On
January 31, Singapore was the first country in Southeast Asia to ban new visitors
of any nationality with recent travel to mainland China. This demonstration of early
preparation and precaution can be contrasted with many countries who did not start
preparation until the virus had already entered their country.
Over the various stages of the pandemic, Singapore swiftly and decisively adapted
to new changes in scientific evidence and information on the situation on the ground.
As more was known about the transmission of COVID-19 itself, Singapore implemented measures based on such evidence. COVID-19 was found to be transmitted via
respiratory droplets and close contact, thus Singapore established a deep cleaning
campaign at public places called SGclean to minimize contamination, as well as
introduced stringent isolation measures to minimize contact. When imported cases
were on the rise, Singapore imposed stay-home and quarantine orders for incoming
travelers, with strict penalties for non-compliance. When the number of unlinked
community cases spiked, Singapore implemented the circuit breaker to prevent the

10 Science, Social Responsibility, and Education: The Experience of Singapore …

267

virus from spreading further within the community. After discontinuing the circuit
breaker, the Singapore government remained cautious and methodical in its approach
and reopened Singapore in deliberate phases that minimized mingling, keeping the
number of cases under control. To accommodate the increased public movement after
reopening, the government also implemented digital systems such as SafeEntry and
TraceTogether to facilitate efficient contact tracing efforts. Later, COVID-19 was
also found to present as asymptomatic in certain people, thus Singapore engaged
in aggressive testing of high-risk populations (e.g., hawkers, early childhood staff,
incoming travelers, foreign workers living in dormitories), successfully detecting
asymptomatic cases (e.g., Toh, 2020; Yong, 2020) and significantly reducing the
spread of the virus.

10.4 Emphasizing Social Responsibility
Singapore also emphasized the importance of social responsibility throughout the
pandemic. Exercising social responsibility in this time meant ensuring the care and
safety of others in the community. Many measures were based on this principle,
where people who may be more vulnerable to contracting COVID-19 were given
the protection or precautionary advice needed. For example, frontline workers were
supplied with adequate virus protection like suits and masks, and the elderly were
given priority shopping hours and queues at supermarkets to reduce their exposure
in public. Social responsibility was also a consistent narrative used in laying out
precautionary guidelines and rules for the public, such as maintaining one-meter
distances, staying home when unwell, and always wearing masks–it was emphasized
that these measures should be taken to protect our loved ones and others.
These principles of science and social responsibility were also at the heart of
educational policies during the pandemic. Education in Singapore is centralized and
governed by the Ministry of Education (MOE), where there are about 350 primary
and secondary schools and a half of a million students enrolled. COVID-19 related
measures implemented by the MOE were also driven by science and strongly aligned
with those implemented and advised by the Ministry of Health (MOH). This was
made possible by the highly centralized political model on which Singapore operates,
where all government ministries have a strong line of communication with each other,
allowing for swift and consistent implementation across the health and education
sectors. As one of the smallest nations in the world, centralization works well and
can be executed successfully in a coherent, government-wide manner. In comparison,
contention between health and education responses were more prominent in other
larger countries in this book (e.g., United States, Spain) and worldwide.
When Singapore’s MOH raised the DORSCON level to “orange” on February
7, implementation of precautionary measures at multiple ministry levels followed
promptly after. On the same day, MOE issued a press release to step up precautionary
measures in schools (Ministry of Education, 2020e). Large group and communal
activities such as assemblies, camps, and mass celebrations were to be suspended,

268

O. S. Tan and J. J. E. Chua

recess times in schools were to be staggered, and co-curricular activities or afterschool programs could only continue in smaller groups. Any inter-school activities
were also suspended. This was in the first term (quarter) of the academic year and
these measures were set to be in place tentatively until the end of the March holidays,
which is a week-long break in March for students after the first term.
After the March holidays, it was further announced that hygiene and precautionary
measures in schools were to be enhanced. All co-curricular activities and inter-school
activities continued to be suspended or deferred until further notice. All schools were
to adopt cleaning and safe-distancing practices, such as fixed exam-style seating for
Primary 3 students and above (where students sit individually with spaces in between
their desks), and fixed group cluster seating for Primary 1 and 2. There were also
wipe-down routines in classrooms and cafeterias as well as assigned seating and play
areas in other parts of the schools. On March 24, a joint statement between MOE
and the Ministry of Social and Family Affairs (MSF) was released to announce
additional precautionary measures for younger students from preschool and primary
school (Ministry of Education, 2020b); students staying in the same household as
a person who had returned to Singapore from any country were to be placed on a
14-day Leave of Absence (LOA).
After the circuit breaker, school measures were also in line with the three phases of
reopening. In Phase 1, only graduating cohorts from primary and secondary schools
attended school physically from Mondays to Fridays, whereas students from other
cohorts rotated weekly between home-based learning (HBL) and returning to school
for lessons to reduce the number of students in schools at any one time. From Phase
2 onwards, all students returned to school from Mondays to Fridays. There was also
resumption of PE lessons and co-curricular activities with the assurance that staff
and students continue to strictly adhere to safety management measures.
These cautiously controlled measures of precaution and safety proved to be effective in protecting our students from contracting COVID-19. As of December 2020,
only about 0.23% of COVID-19 cases in Singapore were children or adolescents aged
20 and below (Covid19 SG, 2020), of which none caught the virus from schools or
institutes of learning. These cases mainly caught the virus from overseas or from
household members who were overseas, suggesting that the LOA precautionary
measure was indeed a sound policy and helped prevent further spread amongst
younger students.
However, although children and young adolescents are less likely to contract
COVID-19 or have their physical health directly impacted by the virus (Davies
et al., 2020; Viner et al., 2020), they risk suffering major detriments to their learning
and development during this time. Disruptions to learning, such as cancellations
of classes, lectures, and national examinations, will put the education of affected
students on hold for a long time. On a larger scale, this poses significant problems
to logistics in subsequent years, such as catching up for all the missed lessons or
having the size of two or even more cohorts sit for a national examination at once.
Singapore was cognizant of such supply-chain shifts or unforeseen consequences
of disrupted learning–not just for students themselves, but for the entire education
system. Thus, on top of protecting the health and safety of students from the virus,

10 Science, Social Responsibility, and Education: The Experience of Singapore …

269

minimizing disruptions to learning was of the utmost importance. This emphasis
was reflected in how strategies to ensure continuity of learning, student engagement,
and innovation in the new learning environment were employed in conjunction with
health and safety measures.

10.5 Minimizing the Loss of Learning and Seizing
Opportunities for Teachable Moments
One way Singapore and MOE helped to maintain continuity of learning for their
students was through helping them and teachers ease into home-based learning (HBL)
during the circuit breaker. Before the circuit breaker started, MOE had implemented
one day of HBL a week for schools, in anticipation of the possibility of a nationwide
lockdown and full-time HBL. This allowed schools to progressively transition to the
online learning model, and for teachers and students to familiarize themselves with
the system. This methodical process allowed for a gradual adjustment into full-time
HBL instead of an instantaneous switch that could cause confusion, unpreparedness,
and backlashes to students’ learning. When the circuit breaker was announced to be
extended for another month to June 1, the academic calendar was also readjusted
to accommodate this change. The month-long mid-year school holidays, originally
scheduled in the month of June every year, was brought forward to the month of May
to coincide with the second month of circuit breaker. This helped to minimize any loss
of learning days at school. Ultimately, Singapore students only missed about a month
of physical lessons at school, and even so, learning was maintained through homebased and online means during this month. The education ministry also took the
opportunities to prepare teachers with resources about the science of the COVID-19
virus and the importance of health and hygiene practices. Schools also capitalized on
the principle of social responsibility and emphasized educating students on the need
for social distancing, isolation of infected persons, and strategies of controls such as
screening and contact tracing. These were also opportunities to build resilience and
highlight exemplary care of others through responsibilities and courage.

10.6 Use of Technology: Student Learning Space
In addition, Singapore utilized innovative tools to help sustain student engagement
and motivation under significant changes to the learning environment and mode.
With HBL, replicating the traditional classroom onto an online medium (e.g., videorecording lessons as if they were face-to-face) may seem contrived and may no longer
be as effective or engaging. The biggest challenge here was the ability to capitalize
on online tools to offer better learning opportunities for students (Ng, 2020). On
this front, Singapore tapped into its pre-existing national online learning portal, the

270

O. S. Tan and J. J. E. Chua

Student Learning Space (SLS), as a learning and teaching platform for teachers and
students during the circuit breaker.
SLS is a learning management system containing curriculum-aligned resources for
various subjects and is made accessible to all teachers and students. On SLS, teachers
can share relevant lesson resources and students can access them in a self-directed
manner (Ministry of Education, 2020d). Students can approach various topics at their
own pace and based on their own interests, encouraging personalized learning and
greater student ownership. Resources also come in different forms, such as videos,
animations, simulations, podcasts, and visual texts (Ministry of Education, 2020c).
Using this wide variety of forms and additional tools on SLS (e.g., installing pop up
questions to make students’ thinking processes visible or embedding YouTube videos
for demonstration), teachers can combine and curate resources in their preferred
delivery, and customize them to students’ needs.
Aside from lesson materials, testing materials like quizzes and activities are also
available on the SLS, where students can self-assess their knowledge and obtain
immediate feedback on their performance. Teachers can also monitor their students’
progress on their learning and assessments, both at a class and individual level. This
enables them to make informed decisions when providing targeted intervention to
address any gaps in understanding. Thus, besides serving as a resource bank, SLS is
also an adaptive and interactive platform that streamlines and enhances the distancelearning process by allowing customizability, individualized learning, and engaging
exchanges between students and teachers.
SLS proved to be a useful tool for the HBL period during the pandemic. With
many teaching resources such as lesson plans and curriculum resources already on
SLS, it was easier for teachers to launch into online teaching without the need to
transfer many physical materials themselves. SLS complemented the online video
conferencing platforms teachers used to carry out online lessons such as Zoom and
Google Meet, as well as external resources such as textbooks and workbooks, offering
students a flexible learning experience that may be more engaging and effective in a
home-based environment (Gov.sg, 2020; Teng & Ang, 2020). Nonetheless, teachers’
IT savviness was a crucial factor for the success of SLS and HBL. This could not have
been achieved without ICT being a significant component of the learning technologies
that Singapore teachers are equipped with from pre-service to in-service professional
development. In addition, ever since the SARS pandemic in 2003, schools scheduled
their own e-learning weeks or activities yearly as a routine for teachers to re-acquaint
themselves with educational technology and remain prepared in the event where
virtual learning is needed. Thus, teachers were generally very equipped with the
technological skills needed for virtual learning before COVID-19, making it easier
to mount an initiative for home-based learning during the pandemic.

10 Science, Social Responsibility, and Education: The Experience of Singapore …

271

10.7 Professional Development and the Co-Sharing
Teacher Community
Even so, Singapore ramped up e-learning professional development (PD) for teachers
even further during the pandemic. From the moment Singapore had its first local
case, the Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST) starting proliferating PD courses
to provide support for teachers in navigating the digital space and implementing
online HBL. Thus, on top of e-pedagogy guidance already offered to all teachers,
AST increased the number of PD sessions on the MOE Student Learning Space
to support teachers through this new challenge. Although e-learning has been part
of Singapore schooling since SARS, the national circuit breaker during COVID19 posed an additional unprecedented challenge for teachers that was not present
during the SARS pandemic. During the SARS pandemic, school closures lasted for
a maximum of 1 week, whereas during the height of COVID-19, school closure
extended for a prolonged period of one month.
AST provided PD guidance on two main areas: planning and design, and creation
of e-learning resources and packages. For the former, AST organized learning
sessions, webinars, and workshops to guide teachers on how to plan for and design
seamless school and HBL experiences for students. For example, webinars were organized for Mathematics teachers to share lesson planning examples that took HBL
considerations such as student HBL readiness into account. For Science, workshops
to design blended learning experiences that are seamless and meaningful for students
were conducted, encouraging dialogue between participants so that they could share
lesson ideas with each other and further refinements and enactments could be done
with the guidance of facilitators. For Humanities, different ICT tools that could be
used to enhance the learning experience were shared with and amongst teachers.
Similar courses were implemented to guide teachers in creating effective elearning resources and packages. For Humanities, MOE hosted workshops to provide
guidance to teachers to create e-lessons on the Student Learning Space, highlighting
student engagement, effective assessment for learning, and depth of the subject.
However, perhaps what is most valuable from these PD opportunities is the fact
that it sparked creativity, community engagement, and the effective exchange of
tips, advice, and support amongst teachers themselves. Many learning designers and
teachers have come together to share how they design learning environments using
ICT tools and have made their own creations available through open-source platforms for other teachers. For example, a group of teachers co-created a digital game
undergirded by self-determination theory (Ryan & Deci, 2000) to support teaching of
“Hypothesis Testing”, an A-Level Mathematics topic. The resource was made available for use to all teachers teaching A-Level Mathematics. For Science, members
of Networked Learning Communities co-created and shared resources suitable for
use for HBL. Teachers and professionals brought together by their passion for high
quality education and continued learning for their students amidst challenging times
was indeed a heartening sight.

272

O. S. Tan and J. J. E. Chua

10.8 Challenges of Learning for Vulnerable Groups
Despite efforts to create equal learning opportunities for all students during the
pandemic, Singapore faced many challenges in ensuring equitable access for vulnerable groups of children. For example, during the circuit breaker and HBL period, fault
lines in the digital space started to emerge between children from higher and lower
socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds. While the SLS was meant to be a platform
for all students to have equal access to learning resources, some children from disadvantaged backgrounds did not have digital devices readily available in their homes
to access the portal. For example, the Singapore Longitudinal Early Development
Study (SG Leads) found that 44% of vulnerable families living in rental flats1 do not
have a computer or laptop at home, as compared to 4% for those from higher-SES
families living in private properties. This figure is 54% and 11% respectively for
tablets (Yeung, 2020).
Besides the availability of devices, there are also a variety of other factors that
determine the extent to which students can reap the benefits of HBL, such as physical
environment, parental skills, and connectivity issues (Lee, 2020). Even with digital
devices, many low-income households also lacked the appropriate infrastructure
and environment at home that are conducive for HBL. For example, many did not
have their own Wi-Fi subscriptions at home, including 8% of families in rental flats
(Yeung, 2020), or enough tables and chairs for all children to use, resulting in less
ideal workspaces like the floor or kitchen. Many also had to share small spaces
with other household members, which can be distracting and inhibit students from
focusing. For example, rental flats are usually one or two rooms, with a small living
space of 36 sq m to 45 sq m, yet 40% of SG Leads families living in rental flats have
five or more household members squeezing within that small space (Yeung, 2020).
Such space constraints may cause friction and impact children’s concentration and
learning. Another vulnerable group of students is children with special needs. Many
require face-to-face support for behavioral, emotional, or learning needs, and thus
many struggled during this time with absence of additional support. Children whose
parents work in essential services also lacked caregiving and supervision during this
period.
For such students who may fall through the cracks, Singapore was less prepared
in terms of having measures already in place. This is possibly because of the quick
and unexpected turn of events into a lockdown phase, and the pressing need for
scaling up home-based education (i.e., preparing all students and teachers as a whole).
Nonetheless, Singapore was quick to adapt and rolled out supportive measures once
issues came to light. Children who did not have alternative care arrangements, or
who might need additional school support such as access to digital devices or regular
face-to-face engagement, were allowed to continue going to school during the circuit
1 In Singapore, families’ SES can be roughly identified by their housing types. The most vulnerable

families from low SES backgrounds live in rental units by the Housing Development Board (HDB),
whereas the most advantaged families from high SES backgrounds live in private properties like
condominiums and landed properties.

10 Science, Social Responsibility, and Education: The Experience of Singapore …

273

breaker and had adults available to supervise and support them. In addition, MOE
loaned about 12,500 laptops or tablets to students, as well as 1,200 Internet-enabling
devices to students who did not have enough devices at home for HBL (H. M.
Ang, 2020). Some corporate telecommunications companies such as StarHub also
sponsored students in need with free computer hardware and cables and Internet
subscriptions (J. Ang, 2020). Primary and secondary school students on MOE’s
Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) can also benefit from subsidies under the School
Meals Program (SMP), which was originally set up to provide subsidies for meals
purchased from the school cafeteria and consumed in school. During the circuit
breaker period, these meal subsidies continued to be extended to these students
regardless of whether they returned to school during this time (Ministry of Education,
2020a).

10.9 Lessons Learned and Future Implications
While the COVID-19 pandemic has been an unfortunate occurrence, there are silver
linings and lessons that arose from the situation. Firstly, the pandemic has accelerated
a shift in mode of learning, where many are starting to consider hybrid learning as
a possible way of learning for the future. Hybrid learning combines online educational materials and opportunities for interaction online with traditional classroombased instructional methods. To incorporate the “online” aspect into learning, the
use of digital and online devices as tools is key. In general, there has been a lack of
adoption of education technology solutions in schools in Singapore (Hutton, 2020).
For example, although the SLS was implemented in 2018 and therefore existed
before the pandemic, Singapore had never fully utilized it on a scalable basis; it
was viewed more as an additional outlet for information rather than being integrated
more extensively in day-to-day teaching and learning in school. Its extensive uptake
and utilization were subsequently necessitated and expedited by the pandemic. This
acceleration is also mirrored on the policy level, where the government has made
plans to strengthen measures related to digital learning. For example, a government
plan to roll out personal laptops or tablets for all secondary school students has been
adopted seven years prior, to 2021 (Yuen, 2020). This is with hope of keeping social
mobility alive, allowing all students to access and benefit from learning in the online
and digital domains.
Secondly, the pandemic has also catalyzed a shift of the learning paradigm in
Singapore from a more traditional one-size-fits-all approach, to one that is more
differentiated and customized based on each student’s learning needs, interests, and
capabilities. This allows for learning and teaching that is more targeted and effective in fulfilling each child’s specific potential. The blended learning model allows
for flexibility in learning, especially during home-based components. Therefore,
students who are excelling within the main curriculum can have independent time
during home-based learning to learn about and pursue other things that pique their

274

O. S. Tan and J. J. E. Chua

interest. Materials and resources can also be recalibrated for students to target specific
gaps in learning.
We envisage that the above shifts will translate into practical and policy implications in Singapore’s education system in the future. We observed that education in
Singapore generally tended to be rather conservative in adapting to the changes and
demands of the twenty-first century. The pandemic catalyzed discussions to consider
many of these potential changes as viable and have made people more accepting to
embrace new ways of education. In June 2020, for example, Singapore’s ex Minister
of Education, Mr. Ong Ye Kung, voiced that HBL is set to be a regular part of
schooling past COVID-19 (Davie, 2020), hinting at a shift towards hybrid or blended
learning. Later, in December 2020, it was announced that secondary school and junior
college students will spend 2 days a month doing HBL starting from the third term
of 2021 (Ng, 2020). This signals that more educational shifts will be approaching.
These shifts would not have been so quick to arrive without the pandemic. Because
of the pandemic-initiated shifts, we speculate that many larger educational issues
will arise both in Singapore and around the world, impacting different aspects of the
education system such as curriculum, pedagogy, and structure. For Singapore, this
may allow it to transform to be more aligned with the demands and trends of the
twenty-first century.

10.9.1 Curriculum
Firstly, paradigm shifts in learning involve reconsidering curriculum design in new
learning environments. Curriculum design in Singapore has its roots in the nineteenth
century Industrial Revolution, where knowledge is largely taught within an analytical
framework. Subjects are broken down into smaller modules and taught quite often in
isolation or with little relation with each other in a check-list manner. Curriculum in
Singapore should be redesigned to incorporate the connectivity and relativity between
subjects, so that students at pre-university levels can understand how certain subjects
and topics are interconnected, which will support learning at the university stage
and beyond. For example, subjects that are interfaces between rudimentary subjects
(e.g., biochemistry as an interface between biology and chemistry) can be introduced
before university at primary and secondary levels, rather than solely at the university
level. Interdisciplinary curriculum should be more pervasive within all levels of
education.
The drive towards independent and self-directed learning also supports a shift
away from the analytical framework. One of the goals of twenty-first century education is to instill the spirit of life-long learning, and the effects of the education system
are meant to last for life. With this in mind, learning and its benefits will vary for
everyone, and thus the standardized, module-based curriculum style of the analytical framework may start to lose relevance. At a conference by the Institute of Policy
Studies in January 2021, Singapore’s Education Minister Mr. Lawrence Wong raised
a similar point aligned with this thinking. He mentioned that Singapore will make

10 Science, Social Responsibility, and Education: The Experience of Singapore …

275

fundamental shifts in its model of education and mindsets as part of post-pandemic
plans, such as preventing “front-load learning when someone is young”, or treating
“education as a conveyor belt for the job market” (Wong, 2021). This means that
education should be viewed less as an end to secure a good job, but rather as a
system to cultivate life-long learning habits and skills that are healthy, enjoyable,
and beneficial for each student. The current analytical framework is less adept at
doing this.
Instead, there is a need to retool curriculum design from a thematic approach,
preparing students for society and the workforce as adults by instilling the skills
and habits required. This is especially true since the requirements in the workforce
have also evolved since the nineteenth and twentieth century. Rather than a strong
emphasis on academic excellence, there is an even greater need for overarching skills
like problem solving, critical thinking, and innovation. Apart from the core subjects
and fundamental skill development, curriculum design should encompass the necessary skills and knowledge for students to take on larger, real world related issues
in the future such as climate change, digitalization and automation, and artificial
intelligence.

10.9.2 Pedagogy
Secondly, paradigm shifts also force us to reconsider pedagogical methods. Educational pedagogy in Singapore is still largely teacher-directed, despite some shifts
towards student-oriented engagement and activities. Although research and theories in the past that focused on improving instruction and teaching from the
teacher’s perspective were useful for effective didactics, new ecologies of learning
are emerging where experiential and collaborative learning are even more important
for developing twenty-first century skills. With the new learning environments, such
as online learning or independent learning at home, pedagogical methods need to be
much more facilitative and less didactical. Thus, it is likely that the education system
will transform to incorporate and accept education that is more genuinely studentcentered, where learning is highly personalized and flexible. Instead of having activities curated for them, students can create their own activities and direct their own
learning based on their interests and strengths. This will also open opportunities for
project-based and problem-based learning, where students direct their own learning
with each other, and learn with and from one another. Teachers then take on design,
facilitatory, and coaching roles rather than instructive ones.

276

O. S. Tan and J. J. E. Chua

10.9.3 Structure
Lastly, the structure of the academic or school life may also start to transform to be
more fluid. Currently in Singapore, schools follow a fixed timetable and structure
that students heed. For example, lessons are often organized in 40-min blocks. With
the introduction of the hybrid learning model, the same structure in a physical, school
setting might not be as replicable in the online realm. Thus, it is likely that while
phyysical schooling may maintain some sort of structure and rigidity in its scheduling
and planning to maintain order, adaptations need to be made when students are doing
home-based, online learning, as the demands and environment are different at home.
For example, it may be difficult for students to sit for 40-min blocks at home looking
at a screen, as it is easier to disengage online than in real life. There are also fewer
disciplinary agents at home as compared to in school.
Beyond our Singapore case and looking across cases in this book and worldwide,
our postulation is that future shifts in the education systems around the world may
embrace further structure, curriculum, and pedagogy changes which in some ways
can be captured more broadly in Table 10.1, shown.
To accommodate these potential implications and transformations in the education
system, research is required to ensure the smooth changes in curriculum, pedagogy,
and academic structure. Initially, more research is required to understand learning in
the online environment. In particular, it is crucial to answer key research questions
revolving around students’ and teachers’ online learning and teaching behaviors and
styles. For example, is there a deficit in learning when learning is done online? If

so, what are the mechanisms behind these deficits (e.g., engagement, motivation,
lack of discipline)? Upon understanding the key mechanisms and outcomes, we can
design online learning and tools that mitigate these. More research is also needed
to test new pedagogical methods for teachers, considering the shifting role of the
teacher from a didactic position to a more facilitatory figure. What is the best way
to design the learning environment for students in these new environments? How do
we prepare our teachers to do so? What are the skills and knowledge necessary for
our teachers to become facilitators and designers rather than instructors? Teachers
need to know new methods to engage students online, as well as be able to facilitate
peer to peer discussions both online and offline as we move towards an increasingly
project-based education style.
Ultimately, these movements in the education system need to be well supported
by policy. Measures need to be in place to prepare for these movements. A couple
of issues merit policy attention here. Firstly, with the widespread use of the internet
and online tools, we need online infrastructure that is secure and accessible for
all. Secondly, with possible changes to the way we perceive curriculum, pedagogy,
academic structure, and learning environments in the future, there are needs for
interdisciplinary experts beyond education to support these changes. We need to
draw on the art and science of learning from education, psychology, neuroscience,
and educational technology to understand how people learn best in differentiated
situations and new environments. New policies, guidelines, practices, and measures
need to be explored with participation and contributions from educators and students.
As many parents and teachers are from older generations and are used to traditional
education methods, there should be adequate guidance on how to transition into using
digital devices and platforms, such as using workshops or community partnerships.
Transitions should be as smooth as possible to alleviate anxiety and to motivate the
public to accept and embrace these changes positively.
Lastly, education should not forget its narrative and promise for educating our
future generations, which is that “no child is left behind”. For Singapore, the
pandemic and HBL experiences have shown us that in the context of new learning
environments, we are still inadequately prepared to support vulnerable groups of
children to have equal access to learning opportunities. During the same conference mentioned above, Mr. Lawrence Wong also mentioned striving towards a fairer
and more equal society as one of three “resets” we must adopt in post-pandemic
Singapore (Wong, 2021). Regarding education, he endorsed the distribution of more
resources to schools with a larger proportion of students from lower-income families
or disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g., deploying more allied educators, such as counsellors and student welfare officers to support these students), as well as intervening
early and uplifting children from birth and early childhood as key policy movements.
We recommend that such policy movements should also consider the types of post
COVID-19 education shifts that might happen. For example, shifts to online/digital
media and home-based learning means that more disadvantaged children will have
to assess education from their home environment, where background and family
factors may start to matter a lot more, as compared to attending school physically
where other support systems are in place. Policies should consider how professional

278

O. S. Tan and J. J. E. Chua

support can be best extended to disadvantaged students when they are learning from
home.
Also important to note from a top-down approach is how the mental well-being of
all children can be taken care of during such shifts to blended learning. During
the circuit breaker, Tinkle Friend, a mental health helpline for primary school
pupils received 208 more calls than the previous month, where many children were
concerned with managing online schoolwork and losing their friends (Goh, 2020a).
Similarly, Touchline, a helpline for youth-related issues experienced an increase in
calls during the circuit breaker, and Limitless, a charity which helps youth with mental
health issues, has also seen an increased demand for help (Goh, 2020b). Psychologists explain that children thrive on routine, so the disruptions brought about by the
pandemic are stressful for many. Children and youth may also experience increased
levels of anxiety related to COVID-19 issues, such as lack of personal space and
family issues. While these trends were observed during the full-scale nationwide
lockdown that has passed in Singapore, it is possible that mental health issues will
continue to affect children and youth in Singapore in the future. The pandemic may
be around for a long time, and the shifts towards the blended-learning model might
further disrupt schooling routines or exacerbate issues of personal space and family
issues when students stay at home for longer periods of time for home-based learning.
There needs to be adequate systemic support to protect the well-being of our students
and to help them through such shifts. From a long-term perspective, perhaps education needs to incorporate socio-emotional skills and awareness amongst students and
encourage them to seek help if they face struggles within the home environment.

10.10 Conclusion and Remarks
In conclusion, Singapore’s principles of science and social responsibility undergird
a successful management of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the same principles were
applied to the education system. Science informed measures to protect the health and
well-being of students, and strategies to ensure continuity of learning and engagement
were also executed in a scientific and methodical manner. In schools, teachers also
emphasized the importance of social responsibility during COVID-19.
Altogether, we perceive that some of these successes can be due to the unique
attributes of Singapore’s governance, which contains centralization, multi-ministry
coherence, and a legacy of evidence-based policymaking, all in which were especially
useful during the COVID-19 crisis. Existing systems and the types of education that
occur daily before the pandemic also made swift responses possible. One example

10 Science, Social Responsibility, and Education: The Experience of Singapore …

279

is how teacher education had already incorporated technological skill-building preCOVID-19, as mentioned above. Another example is how the value of social responsibility is very much ingrained in our culture and total defense education,2 such
that citizens do perceive the importance of social responsibility measures during
the pandemic. There is also a strong trust in authority and compliance to rules and
measures.
Although there are limits to a total centralization approach, such as lacking eyes
on the ground to support those who fall through the cracks, the Singapore model does
not hope to become entirely centralized. Instead, it aims to be uniquely balanced in
all areas. Our political model is a balance between authoritarianism and democracy,
or freedom and social constraint. Similarly, we hope to achieve a balance between
centralization and decentralization, such that as we can support the nation as a whole,
we are also able to efficiently identify and support those that are most vulnerable. For
example, MOE moved towards a cluster management of schools in 2006, which is a
move towards decentralization, but improved efficiency in systems on the ground.
Nonetheless, the COVID-19 pandemic has left an indelible mark on our lives,
generating long-term changes for society and education. To prepare for future transformations, Singapore has many struggles to overcome. However, a beneficial consequence of the crisis is that the pandemic has made many related issues visible and
thus accelerated the shift of Singapore’s education system to become more suitable
for the twenty-first century. We anticipate that the same kind of changes will also
surface more broadly in education systems globally.

The Spanish Response to the Covid-19
Pandemic: From Joint Governance
to Lack of Governance
Javier M. Valle and Carlos de Olagüe-Smithson

Abstract On March 9, 2020, to safeguard the health of the population from the
spread of COVID-19, the Autonomous Community of Madrid was the first region
in Spain to suspend in person classroom activity from March 11th. Five days later,
on March 14th, the Spanish government declared a state of emergency and in person
classroom lessons were suspended throughout the country.

This chapter will analyze the Spanish national response to the pandemic, comparing
the approaches of the 17 Spanish Autonomous Communities and focusing on
the details of the first region to suspend classroom education, the Autonomous
Community of Madrid, the capital.
In many cases, teachers and schools reacted quickly to try to maintain educational
continuity for the students through self-instructional courses and procedures for
distance learning. The public education administration did not promptly provide
clear guidelines, in part due to the Spanish decentralized government structure. By
April 2020, distance learning was already offered at most of schools.
In July 2020, the EvAU—the national state exam that provides access to university
studies—was administered to students in person, following strict health care protocols including mandatory mask mandates, hand sanitizer at the entrance and exit of
the classrooms, and a distance of 1.5 m between desks. The pandemic in Spain has
fostered ICT skills in an unprecedented way. For example, teachers and students have
embraced a new way of teaching and learning (with private platforms like Google
Classroom and Microsoft Teams). This development of ICT skills and a new focus
on competences appears to have changed Spanish education in a never-before-seen
way and might have a long-term impact.

11.1 Introduction Organization, Structure, and Legal
Framework of the Spanish Education System
After the dictatorship of Francisco Franco (1939–1978), Spain began a democratic
process affecting all social and political domains. The education system, as part of
this transformation, was reformed with laws proposed by different administrations
representing different ruling parties and coallitions.1
With democracy established by the 1978 Constitution, it became essential to
reform the system to align it with the new democratic political situation. These
reforms, based on new constitutional values, opened the system to the principles of
decentralization, democratization, and participation (Egido, 2005).
Before democratization, the educational system in Spain was one of the most
centralized in Europe, but it was transformed to distribute the responsibility of education among the Central Government and the 17 autonomous regions—Comunidades
Autónomas—(Autonomous Communities). According to the general framework of
the central legislation, these territories have the authority to manage their respective region’s educational system. Those territories which have an official regional
language can use it as the language of instruction.
Many laws were oriented to modernize the educational system during the years
after the approval of the 1978 Spanish Constitution. These laws were passed by
different governments of the two main national political parties, advancing goals
and norms of opposite orientation to guide the Spanish education system, which as a
result experienced alternating changes introduced by administrations with different
political orientations.
These education reforms began under the Socialist Party (1982–1996) with the
University Reform Act (Ley de Reforma Universitaria, LRU) of 1983. This Act
updated the Spanish University system and was based on three constitutional principles: the universal right to education, academic freedom, and the autonomy of
universities. In 1985, the constitutionally recognized educational rights and liberties were regulated in stages, including tertiary education and University level by
the Organic Act of Right to Education (Ley Orgánica Reguladora del Derecho
a la Educación,LODE). This law attempted to democratize the management of
educational institutions and establish school councils in educational institutions and
autonomous communities, and at a national level. Furthermore, this law implicated
one of the most repeated and controversial educational debates in Spain: the status,
management, and funding of private schools. The Act upheld the right to create
private educational institutions, which are private institutions that could receive
public funding under certain conditions described in the law. As a result, private
schools—mainly owned by the Catholic Church and culturally important since the
nineteenth century—were among the academic institutions that could be financed
by the State (Ossenbach, 1996). During the academic year 2019–2020, according to

and summarize the main parts of its academic structure. An extended version of the following
explanation can be found in the mentioned text.

official statistics regarding non-tertiary education, 5,381 out of 9,390 private schools
were financed by the State, out of a total number of 19,149 schools.
In 1990, the transformations of the organization, administration, and management
of the education system were complemented by the modification of the structure of
all educational levels and their curricula by the Organic Act on the General Organization of the Educational System (Ley Organica de Ordenación General del Sistema
Educativo, LOGSE). This law introduced an important structural change and a more
flexible curriculum, inspired by the principles of constructivist educational theories.
The law also extended universal compulsory education up to age sixteen, establishing a model with ten years of comprehensive education (de Olagüe-Smithson,
2019, p. 133).
At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the conservative party (Partido
Popular) introduced another set of reforms to the educational system. The Organic
Act on Universities of 2001 (Ley Orgánica de Universidades, LOU) repealed the
University Reform Act (LRU) and regulated the structure and organization of the
educational system at the university level. The Act on Vocational Training and Professional Qualifications of 2002 modified the LOGSE concerning these modalities of
education. Also in 2002, the Organic Act on Quality of Education (Ley Orgánica de
Calidad de la Educación, LOCE), modified both the LODE and the LOGSE. The
objective of the LOCE was to increase the quality and the performance of education.
However, this law was not implemented due to a change in government which took
place in 2004.
Upon the election of the new socialist government (2004–2011) the law was
modified again in 2006 through the Organic Act on Education (Ley Orgánica de
Educación, LOE), which regulated the Spanish non-university educational system
until December 2013. Additionally, the Organic Act on Universities was amended
to align the Spanish university education with the European Higher Education Area
(EHEA) in 2007 (Organic law 4 of April 12, 2007, which modifies Organic Law 6
of December 21, 2001).

11.2 The Current Educational System in Spain
After almost eight years of socialist government, the 2011 election gave the conservative party the absolute government majority. In December 2013, this new government
approved the Act on the Improvement of the Quality of Education (Ley Orgánica de
Mejora de la Calidad Educativa, LOMCE) to again modify the educational system.
This law affected the levels below tertiary education, prioritizing the improvement of
educational quality, the increase of youth employability, the modernization of vocational training, and the reduction of drop-out rates.2 Although this Act intended to
modify the LOE of 2006 only slightly, the measures were strongly criticized across
2 Early leavers’ rate was 31% in 2002; it remains in 17% in 2019, far from the European Union
target for under 10% by 2020.

286

different sectors. The Act had no broad political consensus and was only supported
by the government’s majority party. Most of the opposition parties opposed the law.
In December 2020, the coalition government of the socialists and communists
elected in 2019 passed the new Act “Ley Orgánica 3, 2020” (BOE, 2020).
These frequent changes to the legal framework constitute one of the main challenges for educational policy in Spain: the lack of stability and continuity resulting
from an elusive education consensus between the main political parties in Spain. The
resulting short policy cycles are seen as a problem by different education stakeholders
including teachers’ and parents’ associations, but also academics and specialized
media. For example, the President of the Spanish Federation of Public Schools Principals’ Associations said that they deeply regret the lack of consensus in passing the new
law of education, and they encourage political parties and educational communities
to work together to avoid more reforms without consensus in the future.3
The abundance of education laws since 1990 (and their corresponding regulatory
developments) and the continuous legislative changes and lack of policy continuity
have produced teacher fatigue and confusion for parents and society. While politics
often influences educational changes, in the case of Spain, these political fluctuations
have resulted in a failure to achieve a national consensus and stability for education.
It has not been possible to consolidate a stable regulatory framework, nor permanent
laws, and consequently there has not been steady education development (Antiñolo,
Molina, & Pérez, 2014).
However, despite the proliferation of educational laws, some characteristics of the
educational system have remained relatively stable; some of the guidelines for the
progress of Spanish education have remained unchanged over the last few decades.
Two among these help understand the Spanish educational response to the COVID-19
pandemic: (1) the educational administration model and (2) the overall organization
of the different levels of education.
Concerning the school system administration model, powers and responsibilities are shared between the State and the Autonomous Communities. According
to the Spanish Constitution, Article 139.1.30 (Constitución Española, 1978), the
State is responsible for ensuring basic minimum program standards (curriculum
and qualifications) across Spain and guaranteeing the educational rights of Spanish
citizens. That is why the State plays the primary regulatory role on educational
issues, but Autonomous Communities are uniquely responsible for the administration and organization of the educational system in their respective regions, save the
powers reserved to the State. Autonomous Communities regulate school programs
beyond the minimum structure and content determined by the State and handle school
personnel, grants, and support services. Nevertheless, despite the changes meant to
decentralize the educational system, local government authorities and individual
schools play a limited role. Officially, schools have certain pedagogical, organizational, and managerial autonomy, but the decentralization process has not fully
empowered these educational institutions. Spanish schools are characterized by

limited autonomy, whereas most decisions are made by the educational administration. As a result, schools do not have the ability to effectively adapt to changing
environments and policy priorities (Egido, 2005). In the pandemic context, schools
have been paralyzed, without the autonomy to offer contextualized responses; they
completely depended on the state and regional education authorities that offered slow
and contradictory guidelines.
The structure of the educational system has remained relatively stable since 1990,
despite the multitude of laws that have changed curriculum and school organization.
The structure contains five levels: Infant Education, Primary Education, Compulsory
Secondary Education, Upper Secondary Education and Higher Education. The first
stage in the general educational system is Infant or Pre-primary Education and it is not
compulsory. It has two levels: from age 0 to 3 and from age 3 to 6, the latter of which
is free in all publicly funded schools. Primary Education is the first compulsory stage
and lasts six years, between the ages of 6 and 12. Compulsory Secondary Education (Educación Secundaria Obligatoria, ESO) is the second compulsory stage and
covers four school years, for pupils between the ages of 12 and 16. Together Primary
Education and Compulsory Secondary Education constitute the “Basic Education”,
ten years of free and compulsory education for all students.
After compulsory education, pupils can access Upper Secondary Education that
is also offered in Secondary Schools. It lasts two academic years, usually studied
between the ages of 16 and 18. It is offered at Vocational Training integrated
institutions and in national reference institutions, and it also offers two pathways:
Bachillerato (mainstream branch of general upper secondary) and Intermediate
Vocational Training (professional branch or technical upper secondary).
Finally, Higher Education includes university and non-university tertiary education. University studies, include Bachelors, Masters and Doctoral Degrees as
established by the integration of Spain in the European Higher Education Area
(EHEA). Non-university tertiary education includes Advanced Vocational Training
and Specialized tertiary education. Although Spain’s tertiary educational system
consists of both university and non-university institutions, it operates—unlike other
European systems—as a system primarily consisting of university institutions
(OECD, 2009).

11.3 The Response to the Pandemic and the Impacts
on Education
On March 9, 2020, to safeguard the health of the population from the spread of
COVID-19, the Autonomous Community of Madrid was the first region in Spain
to establish extraordinary measures to handle the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
pandemic (Comunidad Autónoma de Madrid, 2020). One of the primary actions was
the decision to suspend classroom activity at all levels, from formal education to
its complementary educational activities. The regional government recommended

288

J. M. Valle and C. de Olagüe-Smithson

resuming teaching online. Presuming a mitigated epidemic spread, schools were
expected to reopen on March 26th.
On March 14th, the Spanish government with the Royal Decree 463/2020 declared
a state of emergency to manage the health crisis created by COVID-19 (Boletín
Oficial del Estado, 2020). Article 9 suspended face-to-face educational activity in
all institutions and stages, cycles, degrees, courses, and academic levels included in
article 3 of the Organic Law 2/2006 of Education (BOE, 2006), including university
and all other teaching activities in public or private centers. During the suspension
period, the educational activities were to be offered, if possible, remotely.
According to Zubillaga and Gortazar (2020) these measures affected nearly 10
million students in Spain and exacerbated problems in the Spanish educational
system. The switch to online teaching was immediate and abrupt with no time for
teachers to plan and design new learning procedures; it became an Emergency Remote
Teaching experience, like the situation in other countries around the world (Hodges,
Moore, Lockee, Trust, & Bond, 2020).
This sudden transition of the teaching model highlighted several systemic gaps
(Fernández Enguita, 2020):
– Access gap: as some students lacked an internet connection and electronic equipment at home. According to the National Institute of Statistics (INE) in 2019,
90% of the children between the ages of 10 and 15 in Spain have a computer
at home and 93% of them have used internet during the last 3 months. 66% of
these teenagers own a mobile phone. These figures suggest that Spanish youth
had sufficient equipment to participate in online classes.
– Students´ usage gap: stemming from lack of students´ ICT (information and
communication technology) literacy and capacity to use different hardware and
software tools to learn. According to the European Monitor for Education and
Training (November 2020),4 15% of European students do not have sufficient
digital competencies.
– Teachers ICT gap: stemming from the combination of insufficient teachers´ ICT
training and lack of proficiency in the use of online platforms and interactive
audiovisual material. 50% of the school principals mentioned that teachers in
their schools had the capacity and resources needed to teach online (Zubillaga
& Gortazar, 2020). However, families had difficulty sharing their time and ICT
resources; parents had to simultaneously telework while the children attended
online schooling (Santos-Montealegre, 2020, p. 87).
The Vice Councils of Education Policies and Organization of the Autonomous
Community of Madrid published on March 10th instructions for the education
centers to establish rules to continue with distance and online teaching (VICECONSEJERÍAS DE POLÍTICA EDUCATIVA Y DE ORGANIZACIÓN EDUCATIVA 2020, March 10). Seven instructions established that all personnel should
continue attending the schools (except infant schools) and teleworking should be

promoted (as long as it was compatible with the continuation of the academic activities). The teachers should adapt their academic program to include home-based
activities. The High Schools should pay special attention to students preparing
the “Evaluación del Bachillerato para el Acceso a la Universidad (EBAU),”
the Spanish official university entrance exam. Teachers maintained contact with
students and parents through the Learning Management System LMS platform
EducaMadrid, the schools’ websites, the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) for
education platform Roble, email, and other communication methods (including
Google Classroom and WhatsApp).
Several teacher unions and labor organizations protested about these guidelines
because they forced personnel to attend the schools without sufficient health
protection measures. The following day, the Vice Councils published a modification “promoting teleworking,” but did not comment on whether academic activities
should be guaranteed (VICECONSEJERÍAS DE POLÍTICA EDUCATIVA Y DE
ORGANIZACIÓN EDUCATIVA, 2020 B).
During the following weeks, institutions across the country discussed different
teaching scenarios, but the direct responsibility for real time decisions was left to
the school management boards, even though they were not legally entitled to it.
The schools supported their communities to lessen the impact of the sudden
shortage of resources: e.g., donated cleaning material, used 3-D printers to make
face protection equipment,5 and volunteered health care students at hospitals and
elderly residences.
During this period, the Education Council of the State published two proposals:
a brief list on March 20th and an extended version on April 7th (Consejo Escolar
del Estado, 2020), which suggested two possible scenarios:
– Classrooms lessons might resume before the end of the school year. In this case,
teaching should focus on essential contents and basic competencies. The lessons
not easily learned at home would not be reflected on students’ final grades.
Disadvantaged families should have a fair access to education in these conditions.
– Online teaching continues until the next school year.
This is the scenario which was adopted. In this case, the Council urged the administration to provide tools to evaluate the students remotely. It also proposed to only
consider academic performance in the first two trimesters (before the pandemic) to
determine whether students had successfully completed level 4th ESO (last compulsory secondary education level) and 2nd Bachillerato (University studies entry
level).
The Education Council of the State6 also recommended other provisions:
EBAU university entrance exam: Establish common criteria among all
Autonomous Communities about the structure and contents of the exam.

as-3d/.
6 The Scholar Council of the State includes stakeholders in education. The council regularly analyzes
the situation of education in Spain and offers its opinion.

290

J. M. Valle and C. de Olagüe-Smithson

Vocational Education and Training: The compulsory workplace learning should
be reduced and substituted, if possible, by online alternatives.
Special Needs Education: The Councils recommended that the public administration provide measures to prevent infections, while increasing the material and
human resources at these schools.
The Council urged the administration and the media to publicly recognize the
efforts of the teachers, families, and students to maintain academic activities during
the very complicated conditions created by the pandemic.
In Madrid, new instructions concerning the third trimester and the end of the
school year were not published until April 21st (VICECONSEJERÍA DE POLÍTICA
EDUCATIVA, 2020). In these instructions, the Autonomous Community of Madrid
established that teaching should address all competencies and contents in the courses,
including those planned to be taught during the third trimester, which contradicted
with the recommendations of the Education Council of the State. Other autonomous
communities did not focus on teaching new content and used the time to review
previously taught skills and material.
Every April, evaluation exams of the last courses of primary and secondary
education are carried out nationwide. In 2020, these exams were canceled (MEFP,
2020).
In May, the pandemic restrictions began to ease. Orders SND/399/2020 and
SND/414/2020 of the Ministry of Health described the guidelines to limit risks. Two
stages, Phase 0 and 1, established that in person classroom instruction could resume,
but the orders did not mention specific rules for schools to follow. This situation
created confusion in schools because there were no clear guidelines to follow.
On May 17th, Madrid published instructions to adapt education to the new situation (VICECONSEJERÍAS DE POLÍTICA EDUCATIVA Y DE ORGANIZACIÓN
EDUCATIVA, 2020). These instructions transcribed the former orders of the Ministry
of Health and made the principals of the schools responsible for the health protection
of the academic community. However, once again, the instructions did not provide
detailed rules to follow during classroom instruction, for example. The administration did not provide any extra resources to help schools adopt health protocols for in
person instruction.
On May 22nd, new instructions for student and teacher examinations and evaluations were published (DIRECCIÓN GENERAL DE EDUCACIÓN SECUNDARIA,
FORMACIÓN PROFESIONAL Y RÉGIMEN ESPECIAL, 2020). The deadline for
these actions was June 16th.
At the end of May 2020, the health situation had improved, and the Autonomous
Community of Madrid wanted to resume in person classroom education in June. The
instructions from May 27th urged schools to organize support classes, mainly for
students in 2nd Bachillerato that had to prepare the EBAU exam that would take
place in July (originally planned for the beginning of June).
As mentioned, in Spain, the responsibility for educational matters has been transferred to the 17 Autonomous Communities. To try and set common policies and

11 The Spanish Response to the Covid-19 Pandemic …

291

guidelines, the communities worked together with the national Ministry of Education and Vocational Education and Training in an advisory board named Sectorial
Conference on Education. After the session held by this board on June 11th, on June
22nd, the Ministry established and published the measures for prevention, hygiene,
and health promotion against COVID-19 at education centers for the school year
2020–2021 (MEFP, 2020 B).
This document had two objectives:
(1)
(2)

Create healthy and secure school environments with prevention, hygiene, and
health promotion measures.
Enable an early detection of cases and their adequate management with clear
protocols and promote the coordination of stakeholders.
This document established four key guidelines:

(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)

Limitation of contact with others, separating 1.5 m or creating stable coexistence groups.
Hands and respiratory hygiene
Sufficient ventilation and frequent cleaning of the schools
Adequate and early management of patients

According to that document, each center had to have a Plan for the Beginning
of the School Year and a Contingency Plan. It proposed the creation of COVID19 teams within schools with members from different areas (management board,
cleaners, families, students) to ensure the accomplishment and communication of
the key goals.
A 26-page document listed detailed measures that described how to implement
these four key guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in schools. As mentioned
before in this chapter, the Ministry for Education and Vocational Education and
Training offered national guidelines, but the responsibility to act in Spanish education
was transferred to the Autonomous Communities.
During the next few weeks, the speed of the political actions taken to implement
these measures in each of the regions had a direct effect on the milestones for the
next school year starting in September 2020 (Trujillo, 2020).
It is very difficult to consolidate the decisions of the different Autonomous
Communities during the summer of 2020:
– Several instructions, documents, and laws were published to modify previous
versions.
– The media reported political decisions or ideas that were not sustained by official
laws, had no assigned budget, and/or had no deployment plan.
– There were backstage actions that were not publicized or programmed: safety
equipment or money, e.g., was suddenly sent to schools.
Each Autonomous Community published the definitive instructions that were to
be considered by the schools to organize the school year at different times. There
was also great variability in the dates when material and human resources would be
made available to schools.

292

J. M. Valle and C. de Olagüe-Smithson

In the case of the Autonomous Community of Madrid, at the beginning of July
2020 the instructions (VICECONSEJERÍAS DE POLÍTICA EDUCATIVA Y DE
ORGANIZACIÓN EDUCATIVA, 2020 B) established four possible scenarios:
– Scenario I: Extraordinary hygiene scenario. This was the initial planned scenario
for the school year 2020–2021. Hygiene had to be guaranteed. If the distance of
1.5 m between the members of the academic community could not be maintained,
masks had to be worn.
– Scenario II: If the health crisis worsened, face-to-face lessons would be cancelled.
In Primary Education, the groups of students had to be in stable coexistence groups
of a maximum of 20 pupils. In Secondary Education, students had to be offered
between 30 and 50% of their lessons in person, while the rest could be offered
remotely.
– Scenario III: Lockdown. All teaching would be offered remotely. The LMS
Educamadrid would offer online exams.
– Scenario IV: Normality. The COVID-19 problem disappeared, and standard in
person education would resume.
Considering that in July, Madrid planned for Scenario I for the 2020–2021 school
year, the schools’ organization instructions were very similar to those published
during previous non-COVID-19 school years (VICECONSEJERÍAS DE POLÍTICA
EDUCATIVA Y DE ORGANIZACIÓN EDUCATIVA, 2020 C).
Several organizations noted the need to increase resources to guarantee health
and teaching conditions during the coming school year. For example, ADIMAD,
the Association of High School Principals in Madrid, mentioned it was impossible
to guarantee distances of 1.5 m under the standard conditions and requested more
teachers to handle the academic deficits created by the pandemic (Torres Benayas,
2020).
In Madrid, during July 2020, all the planning and organization of the new school
year was done mainly under pre-pandemic conditions and with no useful increase of
material and human resources.
In a press release on August 25th, the President of the Autonomous Community of
Madrid—Isabel Ayuso—informed that the new school year would start with Scenario
II, and new material and human resources would be assigned (Ayuso, 2020). This
announcement modified the initial instructions to increase protection measures, but
this modified version still assumed Scenario I as the official starting situation (VICECONSEJERÍAS DE POLÍTICA EDUCATIVA Y DE ORGANIZACIÓN EDUCATIVA,
2020 D).
As result of the coordination with 17 Autonomous Communities, the Ministry of
Education and Vocational Education and Training published the agreement to adopt
public health coordinated actions during the 2020–2021 school year on August 27th
(MEFP, 2020C).
Despite this agreement, the plans of the 17 Autonomous Communities had
differences. Navarra, Castilla y León, and País Vasco continued offering 100%
instruction in person while the remaining communities combined online teaching
at different levels (Sánchez Caballero, 2020). ACADE, the Association of Private

11 The Spanish Response to the Covid-19 Pandemic …

293

Schools, demanded similar criteria nationwide, eliminating region-specific guidelines (ACADE, 2020).
To increase the distance between students, smaller student groups were created,
increasing demand for teachers throughout the country. This increase in the demand
for teachers created a deficit in several regions that competed to attract human
resources.
In September 2020, the Spanish Government transferred COVID-19 funds to each
Autonomous Community to finance actions in education (Ministerio de Hacienda,
2020) (Table 11.1).
PROA + (20–21) was a national fund implemented to finance orientation,
progress, and enrichment of education from the COVID_19 emergency (Secretaría
de Estado de Educación, 2020) (Table 11.2).
The extraordinary amounts assigned to education during the pandemic represent
around 0.2% of the GDP. As a result, there has been an increase of the total Spanish
education budget from 4.2 to 4.4% of the GDP (Consejo Escolar del Estado, 2021).
FEDADi, the Spanish Federation of Public Schools Principals’ Associations,
prepared a report in October 2020 that described the beginning of the school year
in Spain (FEDADi, 2021). Nearly all the Autonomous Communities modified their

previsions from July. 60% of them changed the school year start date. Teaching was
heterogenous, with different amounts of classroom and online teaching depending
on the different communities and levels. In some regions, face-to-face teaching was
authorized once lessons had already started, discriminating against schools that were
not able to adapt. In nearly all cases, the administration had been in contact with the
educators’ associations, but in general it did not establish agreements with social
stakeholders.
FEDADi notes that the number of teachers increased in most cases, reducing the
student-to-teacher ratio. In some communities, it was very difficult to hire personnel
for specific subjects. Protocols were constantly adapted to the pandemic situation,
increasing stress for the entire education community in the school. The responsibility
was mainly on the management teams, sometimes supported by specific personnel.
Around 20% of schools considered using additional facilities outside their standard
location. Nearly all administrations provided hygienic and health protection material,
but only around half of them provided technological equipment. The decision of
whether to use official online platforms or other tools was not unanimous. There
were very few specific compulsory training activities, but there was a great range
of elective courses. There was no increase in the number of school buses. Some
of the communities decided to cancel services like the canteens and libraries. The
extracurricular activities were mostly all cancelled. The inspection services offered
heterogeneous approaches and FEDADi mentioned it would have been useful to
reduce bureaucracy and increase collaboration.

11 The Spanish Response to the Covid-19 Pandemic …

295

Student academic achievement seems to have decreased. Ferrero mentioned that
Adimad stated that students in 3rd ESO (between 14 and 15 years old) appeared
to have failed 15% or 20% more subjects during the first trimester (September–
December 2020) compared to the same period in 2019 (Ferrero, 2021).
Sanz, Cuerdo, and Doncel (2020) concluded that “during the closure of the centers
due to COVID-19, there was a notable increase in the use of digital resources
compared to the last five years, although this increase was not homogeneous between
applications or between regions. However, in Spain there was no divergence in access
to digital educational resources due to the level of family income, at least regarding
free access digital educational resources.”
The State Education Council published the first version of its report of the postpandemic Spanish educational situation in January 2021 (Consejo Escolar del Estado,
2021). This report mentioned that in November, only 0.09% of schools closed because
of COVID-19 cases after opening in September and 13.37% had classrooms under
quarantine. Considering the data, the incidence of the pandemic at schools was lower
than the general average. The age group with the highest incidence of contagion
(ages 15 to 29 years old) caught COVID-19 at social and familial activities, but not
at schools. This suggests that school precautionary measures were successful.

11.4 Conclusions
The education measures adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic should be analyzed
in two different periods: until the end of the 2019–2020 academic year (March to
July 2020) and during the first trimester of the 2020–2021 school year (September to
December 2020). During the first period, most face-to-face instruction was suspended
and repliced by online modalities. In some cases, small groups in Bachillerato
returned to the classrooms in June to prepare for the university access EBAU exam.
During the second period, students mostly returned to the classrooms with health
risk control measures (masks, security distance, intense disinfection and ventilation,
small “bubble” groups within classrooms, etc.)
In both cases, it is possible to draw several conclusions about the measures taken.
We will try to examine the causes and present the consequences elicited in each set
of measures.
(1)

In Spain, measures were taken late. There were no proactive policies; actions
were slowly reactive to the pandemic development, with no previous plan of
action. In January 2020, the Spanish government learned about the situation
in China7 and Italy (a neighboring country with many international exchanges

7 In January, a large number of reports warned of the seriousness of the situation, like those trans-

mitted by the workplace hazard prevention service of the national police (Servicio de Prevención de
Riesgos Laborales de la Policía Nacional), the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) and the
National Intelligence Centre (CNI). Also, January 30th the World Health Organization indicated
that COVID was a “public health risk of international concern". A confirmation that the existing data

296

with Spain).8 In those places, infected patients, and deaths rapidly increased.
The government did not take any precautionary measures with travelers coming
from these two countries; for example, temperature checks were not instituted,
negative virus tests were not requested (although Italy, for example, had already
implemented them).
The borders were not closed, and it was not compulsory for the population to wear
protective masks; it was only a recommendation, but there was no insufficient stock
to meet the demand for face masks. International sport events (like the Valencia—
Inter Milan soccer Champions League match on March 6th), political meetings (Vox
party in Vista Alegre, Madrid on March 8th), public festivals like the Mascletá in
Valencia and the feminist demonstrations to celebrate the 8th of March (attended
by many government members) continued to take place. Only one major event, the
Mobile World Congress of Barcelona, planned for the 24 to 27th of February, was
cancelled on February 12th, but the decision was made by the organizers and not
by the health authorities. It was not until the state of emergency on March 14th that
implementation of those measures began.
(2)

Measures were taken with no political consensus. The political stakeholders
did not assure a trustworthy and responsible national behavior. The government´s strategy did not have the approval of the parties in the opposition nor
support from some regional institutions; different Autonomous Communities
took actions that did not coincide with the national government proposals. The
strategy should have been national, but it was strongly criticized because there
was no consensus, and it was undermined by the regional governments. Some
critics were regional Presidents belonging to the majority party (as the case
of Emiliano García-Page, regional President of Castilla-La Mancha, from the
Socialist Party).9

There was no consensus between the central government and the governments
of the Autonomous Communities. The different political parties did not agree on

urged action before March (44 days after the WHO´s alert) is that February 12th, John Hoffman,
organizer of the Mobile World Congress, announced the cancelation of the event (expected to attract
100.000 visitors from all over the world to Barcelona). As a result of this announcement the Spanish
Health Minister mentioned that “There is no public health reason that prevents celebrating an event
of these characteristics in our country”.

basic common actions (for example, even votes in the National Parliament regarding
declaration of a state of emergency were far from unanimous).10
Spanish Education and Health Care decentralization hindered agreement on safety
measures, such as deciding and organizing the acquisition of protective equipment
like masks for health professionals and the general public or the acquisition of
ventilators for hospital emergency units.
High political polarization also hindered consensus. The Spanish parliament after
the 2019 election represents 16 political parties (Parlamento Español, 2019). The
parties Podemos (a radical left-wing party) and Vox (a radical right-wing party)
defend extreme opposite ideas and foment the division of the chamber in two blocks.
The government of PSOE and Podemos depends on the constant support of several
parties of the Congress Chamber to achieve the necessary majority to approve each
decision.

(6)

Instructions were improvised; it was difficult to determine outcomes. At
the beginning, the actions taken were late and erratic; an example was the
constantly changing information provided by the central and regional governments. The constant updates indicated that the policies were reactive and neither
meditated, proactive, nor strategic.
There was considerable misinformation that led to uncertainty. At the beginning of the pandemic, there was no conceptualization of how the school year
would end. There was also a great deal of uncertainty about the conditions to
return to face-to-face teaching; many of the instructions and measures were
not ready until a few days before the start of the 2020–2021 school year. The
lessons from the first wave should have been learned from March to June,
but uncertainty remained until the beginning of September, the month when
classes traditionally resume. Consequently, the school year was delayed, and
school actions were hastily adopted.
Low ICT skills of the teachers and students. The teachers did not have sufficient
digital competence that could help them develop online classes during the
lockdown. Some homes had insufficient ICT resources, but the impact on lowincome households was less than expected. “In Spain there was no divergence
in access to digital educational resources due to the level of family income, at
least with regard to free access digital educational resources.” (Sanz, Cuerdo,
& Doncel, 2020)
The individual effort of the management teams of the schools and teachers
was considerable and very positive. The personnel of the schools were able
to offer an alternative education with distance teaching. Their ability to provide
learning options has been critical to develop the key actions needed to provide
online teaching first and to prepare the classrooms for safe face-to-face teaching
after the lockdown. The schools have worked reasonably well thanks to its
personnel and despite the political mismanagement.

10 Results in October 29th vote in the National Parliament to prorogation Alarm State was 194 in

favour and 152 not in favour (against or abstention).

The Impact of COVID-19 on a Fragile
Education System: The Case of South
Africa
Crain Soudien, Vijay Reddy, and Jaqueline Harvey

Abstract This chapter provides a critical look at what COVID-19 meant for the
education sector in South Africa. It documents the path of the pandemic in the
education space to understand its effects and the short-term responses of the education
system. It begins with the premise that the South African educational system is structurally fragile. Its fragility arises out of the injustices of the apartheid system which
disadvantaged schools and learners. It argues that the country has made progress
in dealing with this legacy but that the drivers of change, such as improved household incomes, improved access to school materials and better nutrition, have come
under strain in recent times. Because of COVID-19, the upward social mobility of
low-income communities is growing in precarity while inequalities are exacerbated.

12.1 Introduction
As the world enters its second year of facing the COVID-19 pandemic, it is not only
appropriate but necessary that the effects and implications of the pandemic on key
social institutions, structures, and individuals are understood well. They need to be
understood to assist with the immediate crisis—the urgent containment of the most
egregious effects of the disease. More importantly, they need to be understood for
the task of looking toward the future.
This future-oriented task will aid in the development of strategies that will position systems and institutions to anticipate and prepare for future similar events and
leverage this crisis to make fresh starts where systems, processes, and practices have
clearly not worked, not supported everyone equally, and not offered individuals and
communities the opportunities to which they have a legitimate claim. This task has
immediate relevance for systems of health and social welfare. It applies, however,

poignantly, to the question of education in the circumstances during the COVID-19
pandemic.
Understanding the existing social context is crucial in making sense of the impact
of COVID-19 on South Africa, an enormously complex society. While it is a middleincome country, alongside of countries such as Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, and Malaysia,
and therefore has access to resources and infrastructure affordances not at the disposal
of poorer countries, its social, religious, linguistic, and cultural diversity is overlain
with the deep fractures of race, gender and class. While South Africa has made
progress in reducing extreme poverty, ‘largely due to redistributive transfers in the
form of government grants’ (Zizzamia et al., 2019: 3), poverty rates remain high.
Zizzamia and his colleagues’ estimate is that while the country’s middle class has
grown, and has diversified in racial terms, it only stands at approximately 25% of the
national population. In 2015, 55.5% of South Africa’s people could not afford to meet
their basic needs (Stats SA, 2017). An important distinguishing feature of the country
is the social precarity of people who are around the food poverty line of R515 per
month (Zizzamia et al., 2019: 9). Using the metaphor ‘snakes and ladders,’ Zizzamia
and his colleagues emphasize how this precarity is determined by an individual’s
human capital and his/her access to the labour market. They do not specifically focus
on access to education, but it could be argued that insufficient access to educational
inputs is clearly a critical factor in giving substance to this precarity. As we show
below, access remains unequally distributed across the population. How COVID-19
has conditioned this precarity we will only have a good sense of in the future.
We seek to develop a sense of how the effects of the pandemic have played out
in South Africa. The approach we take is to examine the multiple levels at which
these effects are in operation. These include the legacy level, essentially that of race,
the socio-economic level and that of the individual’s attributes. Adapting Amnesty
International’s (2020) categorisation, we work with the approach here that a learner’s
experience of education in South Africa is for the most part contingent on his/her
racial background and socioeconomic status (which overlap significantly), and the
less-well understood factor of his/her individual learning attributes. Inequality arises
due to one or a combination of these factors.
The chapter begins with a description of the country’s socio-economic context,
especially as it relates to the provision of education. It then details the onset of the
pandemic and the measures that were put in place at the national and provincial
levels to mitigate the pedagogical effects of the disruption. These, as will be shown,
were focused on keeping the system on track for meeting the formal requirements
of the learning year. It was clear that the inherent fragility of the system gave it little
room to experiment with new ways of dealing with its inherited and new challenges.
The chapter then offers a broad discussion of the effects of the pandemic on two
levels. The first, to which most attention is given in this chapter, is the systemic
level where the effects of school closures are examined, namely loss of learning
days and educational opportunities for different socio-economic groups. The second
level is that of the individual. A crucial feature of this experience is that many
learners were unable to learn from home; this was primarily reflective of their socioeconomic conditions. They did not have the necessary infrastructure, devices, or

12 The Impact of COVID-19 on a Fragile Education System …

funds to participate. But the challenges were also personal. Children, irrespective of
their social statuses, learn in different ways. These differences are not recognised in
South Africa.
The approach we take in this chapter is largely in the spirit of a critical stock-taking
exercise. It is intended to be both comprehensive and analytic. We have attempted to
locate whatever has been officially released into the public domain by the educational
authorities such as publicly gazetted bulletins and circulars, reports of deliberations,
discussions, and consultations which the authorities have made available. Several
public surveys relating to the pandemic and schooling have been undertaken in the
country. However, most have focused on the public’s attitude to the opening of schools
and the readiness of schools to re-open safely. Although self-reported material exists
in abundance on the effects of the pandemic on learners and their families, this
material describes learners’ experiences in general terms but does not constitute an
empirically grounded resource for describing the effects of the pandemic on learning
and learning attainment or the psycho-social well-being and health of learners. Our
approach strategically interweaves the official data and the copious secondary data
that has become available in our assessment.

12.2 The Beginning of the Pandemic
The first officially recognised COVID-19 case in South Africa was recorded
on the 5th of March 2020. More than a year later, on the 28th of April
2021, the number of infections had reached 1,577,200 cases. The number of
people who had died had reached 54,237 and 1,502,986 had recovered (see
Worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/south-africa/ and Turner et al., 2021). As
with other countries around the world, South Africa introduced strict measures,
including multi-level lockdowns and prohibitions on travel and movement. The
government established two key structures to manage the disaster, a National
Command Council (NCC) consisting of key cabinet ministers under the chairpersonship of the national president and a Ministerial Advisory Committee (MAC) in
the Ministry of Health. The function of the first was to make decisions with respect
to the pandemic itself—the measures to be instituted to manage the pandemic and to
co-ordinate the country’s response to it. The NCC’s challenge was not only that of
saving lives, as was the case for many high-income countries, but, given the precarity
of many households, also of saving livelihoods. That of the second, the MAC, was
to advise on the multiple dimensions and issues relating to the pandemic.
Drawing on these structures, on the 15th of March 2020, the President of South
Africa, Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa, declared COVID-19 a national disaster. A Level 5
lockdown was declared, first for 21 days and then extended for a further two weeks,
and only permitted essential services and business to operate. A R500 billion relief
package was announced for the provision of immediate support to unemployed
workers and distressed businesses. The country, after the middle of April 2020 gradually eased levels of lockdown to Level 1 by September 2020. In the wake of a

306

C. Soudien et al.

resurgence in infection levels during the country’s December national holidays—
when daily infection levels (13,674 people) exceeded infection rates during the peak
of the pandemic in July 2020—the President announced the return to an adjusted
Level 3 Lockdown restrictions. Bans on large gatherings were instituted, movement
across borders limited only to essential travel and the sale of and consumption of
alcohol prohibited in public spaces. In January 2021, the country was placed under
a Level 1 state of lockdown.

12.3 Outlining the Fragility of the South African
Educational System
To understand the impact of COVID-19 on the education system, it is first necessary to
make some remarks about its nature and structure. It is, in its current form, a young
system struggling to divest itself of its apartheid origins. The apartheid order had
created 15 separate racially and ethnically defined education authorities. A system
that has left individuals classified as white as the most advantaged group. In the
closing years of apartheid, the late 1980s, the education levels of the population
were low. Almost a quarter of adults in the 25–64-year age-bracket had no schooling
and only 8% had post grade 12 qualifications (Stats SA, 2011). As Fiske and Ladd
(2004: 44) explain, “as late as 1994, after the National government had significantly
increased spending on black learners, the amount spent per pupil in white schools
was more than two and a half times that spent on behalf of black learners in the urban
townships.”
Apartheid was abolished in 1994 with the ascent to power of an African National
Congress-led Government of National Unity. To achieve a more equitable and
economically productive society, education, schooling, and the economy were prioritised in line with Nelson Mandela’s belief that “education was the most powerful
weapon which you can use to change the world” (Hattang and Venter, 2011: 90). The
new government immediately abolished segregation and inequality in education. It
passed the South African Schools Act (SASA) which deracialized the system and
brought all learners under a unified national authority (DoE, 1996). The national
department had responsibility for policy, but implementation responsibility was
granted to provinces on a subsidiarity basis.
In terms of the provisions of SASA (DoE, 1996) the current system consists of
public and a relatively small number of private schools. In 2016, based on the latest
officially available report from the Department of Basic Education (DBE, 2018),
there were 29,749 established public and registered independent schools in South
Africa. Of these schools were 14,795 primary schools accommodating 6,929,834
learners and 203,139 teachers, 6,186 secondary schools with 3,989,236 learners and
140,532 teachers, and 4,593 combined and intermediate schools with 2,013,465
learners and 74,942 teachers. Of the 13,307,830 learners in the system, 12,342,283
were in ordinary public schools and 590,282 were in private or independent schools.

12 The Impact of COVID-19 on a Fragile Education System …

307

Authoritative analyses of the school system describe it as a two-tiered system,
characterised by the kinds and levels of inequality that are evident in the wider social
system (see Reddy et al., 2012; Hunter, 2019). Seventy-five per cent of all learners
in the system are in no-fee schools, many of which carry the legacy disadvantages
of being largely black and poor, while the other 25% are in privileged schools,
which were largely formerly white and now serve the expanded post-apartheid, and
no longer white-only, middle class (Spaull, 2019: 4). The majority system is beset
by all the challenges that come with racialized inequality: inefficiencies (van den
Berg, 2008), teacher shortages in key subjects (Simkins, 2015) and poor school
climate and discipline (Winnaar et al., 2018). Although school infrastructure and
resources have improved over the last 25 years, some learners still attend schools
which have poor infrastructure and dilapidated buildings, dangerous and unsanitary
pit latrines, issues with water supply, ill-equipped teachers, shortages of learning
materials, large classes, and high dropout rates (see Amnesty International, 2020;
Parker et al., 2020 and Stats SA, 2017). The privileged sector is the exact opposite;
it is higher-performing and highly functional (Amnesty International, 2020). This
structural division makes the management of the system difficult.
This two-tiered character of the system is evident in the country’s performance in
important benchmarking exercises such as the Trends in International Mathematics
and Science Study (TIMSS). TIMSS has been conducted every four years at either
the Grade 8 or 9 level since 1995. With the completion of the 2019 TIMSS cycle, a 25year longitudinal view is now available. TIMSS 1995 ranked South Africa the lowest
of the set of participating countries with a very low mathematics achievement score
of 276 (SE 6.7). Only one in ten learners demonstrated that they had acquired the
minimum mathematics proficiency for their grade-cohort. Improving educational
outcomes in this first eight-year period was difficult. Mathematics’ achievement
scores remained stagnant over the TIMSS 1999 and 2003 cycles. From TIMSS 2003
to TIMSS 2011, the country recorded an increased average mathematics score, and
further increases were noted in TIMSS 2015 and 2019. Between 2003 and 2019, the
mathematics achievement improved by 102 TIMSS points or one standard deviation
(Reddy et al., 2020). The gains were largely due to post-apartheid’s most significant
drivers of social change, improved home and school conditions effected through a
combination of social welfare interventions and socio-economic factors, the provision of social grants, school nutrition schemes and fee-subsidies, improved school
resources and instructional materials, increased proficiency in the language of the
assessment, improved teacher knowledge, increased levels of parental education, and
a greater focus on what happened inside schools and classrooms (Zizzamia et al.,
2019).
The TIMSS 2019 mathematics average achievement score of 389 (SE 2.3) and
the fact that four in ten learners demonstrated that they had acquired the minimum
mathematical proficiencies shifted the categorisation of the country’s educational
outcomes from very low to low. An even bigger success story after 2003 was that the
highest achievement increases came from the lowest performers who were probably
the most disadvantaged learners and who had benefitted most from government’s
interventions.

308

C. Soudien et al.

Despite these developments, two legacy effects are of relevance for this analysis
of the effects of COVID-19 on learner outcomes. First, South African achievement
continues to be linked to race, socio-economic background, and geographic location.
The mathematics achievement gap between fee and no-fee schools in TIMSS 2019
of 75 points indicates that learners from disadvantaged backgrounds still perform at
a lower level compared to their advantaged counterparts (Reddy et al., 2020). Moreover, returning us to Zizzamia et al.’s (2019) characterisation of social mobility as a
‘snakes and ladders’ phenomenon, we must be concerned about how disadvantaged
students are able to sustain the gains they are making given the drivers of change on
which they depend are vulnerable. The mathematics improvement rate from TIMSS
2003 to 2011 was 7.4 points per year, but from 2011 to 2019 decreased to 4.6 points.
We are unable at this point to definitively explain the dynamics behind these shifts
but, following Juan and Visser (2017), suggest that they could be related to significant home and school environment improvements. Among other factors, the cycles of
greatest improvement in TIMSS performance happened during a period when ‘positive changes over time’ were taking place in learners’ home environments (Visser and
Juan, 2020: 19–20). Upward as the improvement trajectory continued, the impetus
faltered after 2011. This was the period, significantly, when socio-economic conditions in the country deteriorated rapidly as unemployment increased. In an analysis of
the impact of COVID-19 on education, the significance of the relationship between
the increased social and educational provision and improved learner educational
attainment cannot be overstated. Our drivers of improvement were compromised.

12.4 Government’s Response to COVID-19
When it became clear that South Africa, like the rest of the world (Zhu and Liu, 2020),
was staring the prospect of uncontrollable contagion in the eye, its government closed
down the schooling system. The Department of Basic Education (DBE) (2020a),
responsible for the administration of all public schools, announced at the beginning
of the national lockdown that:
In accordance with the pronouncement by the President on 15 March 2020, schools will be
closed from 18 March and will reopen on 14 April 2020. This decision has been informed
by the warnings provided by the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and World
Health Organization who have highlighted the alarming increase of infections within the
country over a three day period… Provincial Education Departments, districts and schools
are advised to take advantage of this time and are encouraged to utilise the time effectively
by ensuring that learners participate in established stimulating programmes such as the
Read to Lead programme, maths buddies, constructive holiday assignments, etc. through the
supervision and guidance of parents and the broader community whilst learners are at home.
This will be supported through the provisioning of workbooks, worksheets, readers, etc.

Closing the schooling system required that the DBE plan and inform the public
about the steps it would take to keep the system functional. Within a month, in the
middle of April 2020, the DBE had put in place a COVID-19 response programme
with the support of the National Education Collaboration Trust (NECT), a multiparty civil society stakeholder. A major initiative was put in place to have water
tanks and water supplies provided at every school and community (2020a).
The March 2020 Level 5 lockdown, as indicated above, meant school closures at
the beginning of the school year and the expectation that work, teaching, and learning
would continue from home. The most important elements of this emergency plan
were the following:

5.

6.
7.

9.

A multi-media learner support programme in conjunction with the national
radio and television broadcaster, the South African Broadcasting Corporation,
under the banner: COVID-19 Learner Support. It broadcast lessons through
three public television and 12 national and eight regional radio stations.
Curriculum support lessons were placed online for Early Childhood Development (ECD) and Grades 10, 11 and 12 learners with emphasis on Mathematics, Physical Sciences, English First Additional language, Life Sciences
and Accounting; the provision of access to textbooks and teacher guides; and
arrangements with telecommunication platforms to waive subscription fees and
data costs to make education material accessible to learners.
The DBE upgraded its website. Study material for all grades was uploaded
to this website (www.education.gov.za). Included in this material were study
guides and revision booklets for the senior phase (Grades 10–12), workbooks
for the intermediate phase, and additional material for special needs groups
and for those repeating their studies. Tips were provided to parents for helping
their children learn. Psychosocial resources were also made available including
guidelines for special needs schools.
Multimedia materials supported by mobile applications were made available on
the DBE website.
Email and WhatsApp feeds were sent to teachers who were responsible for
teaching reading and for the management of their schools with advice about
how to manage their children’s learning challenges.
A series of consultations was held between the DBE and teacher unions on
issues that were arising during the lockdown.
The DBE convened two national consultations bringing together approximately
100 educational experts to discuss plans and take advice on the lockdowns.
A monitoring and evaluation programme process was put in place to assess
system readiness for the provision of personal protective equipment, the availability of water at every school, and the levels of capacity in individual schools
to ensure learner safety.

In addition to the efforts of the DBE, the NECT was also able to report
(NECT, 2020b) that the National Association of Social Change Entities in Education (NASCEE), a network coalition of non-governmental organisations, funders and
individuals had committed themselves to a national collaboration compact, developed a web-based platform which indicated the activities and services of NGOs and
funders in response to pandemic and begun coordinating the curation of online and
offline learning content for learners. While this list is not exhaustive, a multifaceted
approach was taken in response to COVID-19-related challenges, although it was
highly reliant on technological and Internet access.
In June of 2020, the DBE (2020b) published its second medium-term plan entitled
School Recovery Plan in Response to COVID-19 (SRPRC). The proposal had initially
been to open schools in June 2020, but because of a spike in infections the date was
pushed forward, and schools ultimately reopened in August 2020. The plan was
based on a phasing-in of grades and a rotational approach. Beginning with learners
in examination classes, Grades 7 and 12 were brought back first and then the other
grades on a gradual basis. The rotational arrangement also made allowance for only
having particular grades in attendance on particular days of the week to minimise the
dangers of over-crowding. Schools were given options for rotation. The document
paid a great deal of attention to the questions of safety and infection mitigation. With
respect to learning, some key purposes of the SRPRC were to:
1.

Develop a Robust Curriculum Recovery Plan

This included a plan for the recovery of teaching and learning time. Attention was
given to the length of the school day, the length of the school term, and a reduction
of time allocated for examinations and assessment. Guidance was also provided to
learners for self-directed learning. The SRPRC (DBE, 2020b: 12), with respect to
self-directed learning, said that “(i)n the case of self-directed learning, the learning
material is prepared in such a manner that learners are able to progress from the
known to the unknown on their own … such content must be well scaffolded and
mediated through templates and vivid examples.” The curriculum for Grade 12 was
not revised.
2.

Manage Examinations and Related Activities

South Africa has a high stakes, externally set matriculation examination. These papers
are normally set a year in advance. The DBE took the decision that the standard June
Examination written by all learners across the system would be set aside. The exit
level examination at the end of the academic year, which under normal circumstances
would take place from late October and in November, would be written in November
and early December. In terms of content, it would remain the same and all learners,
irrespective of their opportunity-to-learn circumstances, would write the same exit
level examination.
3.

Develop Standard Operating Procedures to Guide the Basic Education

12 The Impact of COVID-19 on a Fragile Education System …

311

Sector to Manage and Contain the Spread of Infection
These procedures, aimed specifically at the health and safety of schools during the
pandemic, were authored with the assistance of the Education Technical Working
Group of the MAC and the NICD.
The re-opening of schools was implemented using a ‘differentiated approach’
(DBE, 2020b: 5). Underpinning the curriculum segment of the SRPRC were concerns
about “how much of the curriculum content could not be covered because of … the
lockdown; implications of the lost time for teaching and learning … assessment …;
how can the time lost be recovered or can the curriculum be reviewed to ensure that
the essence of the curriculum is completed in the remaining time available?” (DBE,
2020b: 6). The plan explained that its execution would assist schools to recover
“between 29 and 33 teaching days …. The number of days recovered will be less
than the number of days lost and hence there will be a need for a trimming and
reorganisation in all grades/years, except Grade 12” (DBE, 2020b: 14). The time lost
for Grade 12 learners in particular would be recovered through a shortening of the
period scheduled for examination preparation and the extension of the school day.
Operational principles for guiding the SRPRC were explicitly articulated around
the need for Inclusion and Equity, ‘ensuring that all learners, and particularly the most
vulnerable, access the planned programme’, taking cognizance of the unique needs
of schools, phases and grades/years, ensuring that plans were determined in a flexible
way ‘guided by the scope and size of the school population’, time management to
optimise the use of teaching time, and preserving learning quality and a ‘focus on
skills, knowledge and values, rather just content coverage’ (ibid). It is important to
emphasize that health and safety were the overriding feature in all these plans.
Interestingly, the provincial education authorities, given the subsidiarity principle
around which education is governed in South Africa between the central government and the provinces, largely elected to use the guidelines and resources made
available at the national level. Exceptions to this were the Free State Education
Department and the Western Cape Education Department (WCED). The former,
in addition to repeating the national schedules for radio and television-broadcast
lessons and guides, also made available podcasts of lessons for issues and topics
and gave their learners access to online and recorded tutorials (see www.education.
fs.gov.za). For their part, the WCED (see wcedonline.westerncape.gov.za) not only
provided guidelines for schools for managing the pandemic but made substantial
education resources available for both learners and teachers and, most significantly,
made available weekly lesson plans developed by their internal subject teams for the
entire curriculum. For every subject in every grade there was a lesson plan and an
actual lesson which could be referred to.
The response of South Africa to the pandemic was thus like that of other countries
where an emphasis was placed on the provision of online and hardcopy resources to
facilitate educational processes. We turn now to the impact of the pandemic on the
learning experience. How much learning took place and what is one able to say, with
a reasonable degree of confidence, was the effect of the disruption?

12.5 Education in 2020 and 2021: The Impact of COVID-19
Given the unprecedented nature of the pandemic and the limited empirical data we
have at our disposal, the approach we take below is to work largely speculatively with
respect to assessing the impact of COVID-19 on learning. As we write this chapter,
the results of the National Senior Certificate Examinations, the terminal examination
for the schooling system, were announced. Interestingly, while the national pass
rate declined by 5.1 percentage points, from 81.3% in 2019 to 76.2% in 2020, the
Minister of Education, Mrs. Angie Motshekga (2021), explained that the decline was
attributable to a drop in the performance of progressed learners, a group of candidates
who were repeating their examinations. It is not possible, however, to conclude from
this that COVID-19 has had no effect on learning.
In South Africa, as elsewhere in the world, the educational impact of the pandemic
included the following: (i) learning losses because of school closures, (ii) widening
of pre-existing education disparities and (iii) learning gains made over time would
be wiped out (Dorne et al., 2020; Hanushek and Woessmann, 2020; United Nations,
2020).
During the March 2020 Level 5 lockdown there were two possible ways to
continue with learning activities: online learning or self-learning with parental and
sibling support. Even for advantaged schools and learners who could do so, several
issues influenced the effectiveness of online learning. For example, the urgency of
responding to the pandemic did not allow for the development of an implementation
plan or a system of educator and learner support. Educators and learners were thrust,
almost overnight, into an education model with which few had experience (Doukakis
and Alexopoulos, 2020).
More advantaged schools and households were better able to sustain learning using
online learning strategies, although this required effort and presented challenges for
both teachers and parents. For this group of learners, schooling continued through
online lessons, either through live online teaching or uploaded recorded lessons.
Many disadvantaged schools, however, did not have the means to facilitate satisfactory online learning (Parker et al., 2020; Spaull, 2020). In poorer households,
many children did not have a quiet workspace, desk, computer, internet connectivity,
or parents who had the time or capacity to take on the role of home schoolers. The
2018 General Household Survey estimated that 22% of households had access to a
computer and only 10% had internet access (Stats SA, 2019: 63). Spaull and Van der
Berg (2020: 8), based on a survey they conducted, found that while 90% of South
African households reported having access to a mobile phone, only 60% reported
having access to the internet via their mobile phone.

12 The Impact of COVID-19 on a Fragile Education System …

313

A survey of their members by the South African Democratic Teacher Union
(SADTU, 2021) revealed that two-thirds of learners from poorer households had
almost no communication from their teachers during school closures. During the
time learners remained at home, Spaull and Van der Berg (2020: 9) estimated that
18% of all children in the school-going age group, were in households without
an adult caregiver during the day. What is more, without either teacher contact or
adult supervision many African language mother-tongue learners would have had no
assistance for managing the English in which most of the lessons would have been
delivered.
This differentiation in social capital and resources meant a differentiated set of
learning experiences at home. While all learners experienced learning losses during
this time, because of the lack of access to educational inputs for three-quarters of
learners, almost no learning took place for many children from poor backgrounds.
Several media reports confirmed this. The executive director of a large teacher union
described the situation of Grade 1 learners in several schools in the country: “… (there
is going to) … be a generation of people who cannot read at all. If you think we have a
problem with reading now, watch this space” (Macupe, 2021: 5). Macupe (ibid.) cited
a parent who said that her child was going to high school, but he struggled to read
and write. As we noted previously, the government supported learning programmes
through public radio and television, but these covered limited number of subjects
and grades and were not enough to bridge the divide of unequal access to resources.
On the basis that television programmes were available for only one and half hours
per day, Spaull and Van der Berg (2020) calculated that learners were only receiving
the equivalent of 5% of the instruction time they would have received in a normal
school day.
School closures also meant the halting of supplementary services provided
through the schooling system. For instance, currently, over nine million learners
receive two meals per day through the National School Nutrition Programme
(NSNP). The suspension of this programme during the lockdown period left these
children at risk of being underfed for several months (Le Grange, 2020; Parker et al.,
2020).
For many learners, school is a source of education as well as safety and support.
One school located in a rural area moved final-year learners in with their teachers
to continue their studies and support during lockdown (CBS News 2020). As one
learner stated, many were aware of the importance of education for social mobility
and the reduction of inequality: “There are four people in each room, and we get
lunch there after school. It’s important because getting a good education – especially
in South Africa – it sort of determines where you’re going to end up in life ” (ibid).

12.6 Time Away from Schools and Classrooms: Deepening
and Widening Inequalities
Schools closed on 14 March 2020 and returned in a staggered manner from 8 June
2020. Grade 12 and 7 learners, after not attending school for 28 and 33 days respectively, were the first to return. Grades 5 and 8 were the last to return. They had
been away from school for 81 days (Gustafsson, 2020a; Mohohlwane et al., 2020).
When full classes of the first grades returned (Grades 12, 7, R, 6 and 11) the school
managed the daily distancing by distributing learners into different classrooms. As
the remaining grades returned, to adhere to the social distancing protocols, learners
attended on a rotational basis, perhaps on alternate days. Using official data, the
work of Gustafsson (2020a) shows it is possible to describe the number of school
days that were lost because of the closures (Fig. 12.1).
Gustafsson estimated that most learners could have lost almost 60% of the originally anticipated 198 contact school days. When differentiated by socio-economic
status, learners from the low SES group’s loss rose to 65% of contact time. Grade 12
learners, writing an external standardised examination, which was not adjusted at all,
are estimated to have lost around 35% of contact time. This loss of contact learning
time necessitated a trimming (reduction) and re-organisation of the curriculum for
learners returning to school in 2020. In January 2021, 58% of school principals

reported that they had completed most of the trimmed curriculum for most subjects
(SADTU, 2021).
While we can estimate and quantify the loss of contact learning time at schools,
it is more difficult to quantify actual learning loss. Helpful here is the modelling
developed by researchers such as Maldonado and De Witte (2020). They build on
studies which look at the effects on test scores following long summer breaks (Cooper
et al., 1996), absence from school (Aucejo and Romano, 2016) and the experience of
gaps in instructional time (Lavy, 2015). These studies show that a break from school
routines will lead to learning losses because of memory decay and limited learning
opportunities during school breaks. The implications of their findings are that:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)

There will be learning losses because of pandemic-related school closures.
Learning losses will be higher for mathematics than for reading.
Learning losses will not be uniform, with disadvantaged learners experiencing
higher learning losses (Kuhfeld et al., 2020; Hanushek and Woessmann, 2020).

To estimate the learning losses in South Africa because of the pandemic we chose
to examine the disruptions in 2020 and speculate what possible learning scenarios
could look like. We adapted the World Bank1 methodology which looked at scenarios
for how the learning curve would be affected by school closures to South African
data. We asked the following question: if the TIMSS 2019 achievement instrument
was administered to grade 9 learners in October 2020 (we will call this predicted
estimate TIMSS 2020) what would their mathematics achievement score be?
In TIMSS 2019, the national average mathematics score was 389, with a standard
deviation SD of 77 points, with fee-paying schools scoring 440 (SD of 79) and nofee schools 365 (SD of 61). Across South Africa, four in ten learners demonstrated
they had acquired the basic mathematical proficiencies, with two in three learners in
fee-paying schools and one in four in no-fee schools demonstrating this proficiency.
We plotted the South African mathematics learning curves (Fig. 12.2a). In the
first graph (a), the solid line plots the learning curve of South African TIMSS 2019

mathematics achievement. The second graph (b) plots the learning curve in no–
fee and fee-paying schools. Learners in fee-paying schools (graphs on the right)
achieve higher scores than their counterparts in no-fee schools (graphs on the left).
The vertical dotted line, at the mathematics score of 400, represents the point of
minimum proficiency in mathematics. Learners scoring below 400 points have not
demonstrated the minimum mathematical abilities for that grade.
Our challenge was then to predict the mathematics scores for ‘TIMSS 2020’.
Given the unprecedented nature of the pandemic, the methodological uncertainties
to estimate learning losses, the limited empirical data we have at our disposal and the
little we know about how the curriculum recovery process took place. The methodological approach we took was to review other studies that predicted learning losses
and speculated what the impact of COVID-19 on learning only in 2020 would be.
Many predictions rely on ‘suggestive extrapolations’ from past studies. These
learning losses are predicted in terms of loss of a share of a year of schooling (Azevedo
et al., 2020), reduction in learning gains expressed as percentage loss (Kuhfeld et al.,
2020), loss of future earnings (Psacharopoulos et al., 2020) or loss of years of learning
(Kaffenberger, 2020).
As an illustrative example, Maldonado and De Witte (2020) calculated the effects
of school closures on standardized scores for Grade 6 learners in Belgium using six
years (2015–2020) of standardized test data and administrative data which measured
learners’ socio-economic status. Belgian schools were closed for nine weeks (or one
third) of the school year. In the first three weeks of the school closures teachers
could only repeat and practice previously taught material. In the next four weeks
teachers previewed new materials to be taught when schools would reopen. Most
time was spent on the fundamental subjects: language, mathematics, and reading. It
is estimated that distance learning took place for up to four hours a day, but one third
of learners may have not had access to online learning.
Within this context, the authors found that “students in the 2020 cohort have school
averages in mathematics between one fifth and one fourth of a standard deviation
lower than students participating in the standardized tests in the five previous years”
(page 12). A further finding was that inequality both within and across schools
increased because of school closures.
Although South Africa is far from Belgium geographically and in terms of
demographic and socio-economic characteristics, we will apply the results from
the Belgium panel study to estimate the learning losses in South Africa. Recognising
the contextual differences, we speculate that the learning losses in South Africa will
be higher than in Belgium. Therefore, the application of the results from the Belgian
study presents the minimum learning loss scenario for 2020 in South Africa.
Using the range of learning losses (0.19–0.25), for South Africa we project a
scenario where the loss of learning is by 0.25 SD in no-fee schools and 0.19 SD in
fee paying schools. The decrease on the national score will be by 0.21 SD. Applying
these values to the South African TIMSS 2019 data, Table 12.1 provides the South
African estimates for ‘TIMSS 2020’.
As the projection shows, if the grade 9 classes took the TIMSS 2019 achievement
test in 2020, in a best-case scenario the TIMSS 2020 mathematics scores will drop

from 389 to 373 points. The mathematics achievement will decrease to 425 points
in fee-paying schools and 346 points in no-fee schools. The dotted line in Fig. 12.2a
plots the lower national learning curves and in Fig. 12.2b the lower learning curves
for fee and no-fee schools. Applying the Maldonado and De Witte methodology to
the South African data shows that the ‘TIMSS 2020’ scores have regressed to the
TIMSS 2015 levels where the national score was 372, with fee-paying schools at
430 and no-fee schools at 342 (Reddy et al., 2016).
In TIMSS 2019, 41% of learners demonstrated that they acquired the basic mathematical skills. In 2020, this is speculated to regress back to the 2015 levels of 34%.
The shaded part on the graph represents the share of additional learners who cannot
demonstrate basic mathematics proficiency because of COVID-19 related school
closures.
The sad and uncomfortable truth is that South Africa, which started 2020 with low
and unequal achievement scores, is likely to end the year with even lower achievement scores. The achievement gains made since from 1994 would probably revert
to the achievement levels recorded in TIMSS 2015—a loss of five years of learning.
Additionally, the effect of the pandemic on the education system will widen existing
inequalities.
In this uncharted terrain of the pandemic, encompassing learning losses and
recovery, we do not yet know the number of days that will be lost to school closures in
2021, the quality of engagements learners will experience when they are in school,
and how individual learning recovery will occur. If there is no quick recovery of
the learning losses, our projection is that fewer learners will graduate from the
school with requisite skills and knowledge to access post-school education, training
opportunities, and find an appropriate place in the labour market. Based on what we
have presented here, we argue that COVID-19 will have long-lasting effects on our
education, economic, and social systems.

12.7 Development of the Individual Learner
In the final part of this chapter, we briefly draw attention to the situation of the
individual learner. We argue that we know little about the learning dynamics of individual learners and their experiences of learning in individual subjects. COVID-19
would have brought this phenomenon—how children learn—into the consciousness
of many people, especially parents, in a new and hopefully informative way. As one
of the most challenging issues raised by the pandemic, we suggest more attention is
given to the inequalities that the individual learner experiences.
To understand the circumstances of the individual learner both his/her/their social
and biological factors need to be taken into consideration. They interact with one
another to contribute to individual development, a complex and multi-layered process
(Jotterand, 2018; Stetsenko, 2017). We briefly present the factors of nature and
nurture. As an example, and crucial to learning, individual brain development is at the
intersection of biological development and environmental factors. This is commonly
referred to as brain plasticity which explains how environmental factors substantially
shape neural pathways within the brain. Exposure to protective or risk factors within
our environment contribute to or hinder brain development (Jotterand, 2018; Shavit
et al., 2018; Stetsenko, 2017). This knowledge regarding individual development
represents a shift from biological determinism to an understanding that the individual adapts to various forms of experiential adjustments (Stetsenko, 2017). Thus,
both the biology of the individual as well as factors within his/her/their environment
are crucial influences.
As we move away from biological reductionism, we must understand how actively
human bodies react to, organise, and coordinate their own engagements with the wider
physical, environmental, and social world (Stetsenko, 2017). Drawing from the work
of John Dewey, Jean Piaget, Lev Vygotsky, and others, in the twentieth century,
“human beings are understood to be carrying out, right from birth, the ongoing
process of relational activities inextricably connecting them with their environment
and other people” (Stetsenko, 2017: 127). Development is thus an evolving, lifelong
activity from which arises individual attributes. The individual critically contributes
to and generates his/her/their own development (Stetsenko, 2017). This development,
moreover, does not take place in isolation. It is embedded within collective social
practices and dependent on sociocultural supports, tools, and mediations (Stetsenko,
2017). The social conditions which either afford or impede individual development
are of critical importance, as is the interaction between the individual and that environment (Stetsenko, 2017). Development is thus “the outgrowth of dynamic relations
among the biological and the social, between the individual and others—other people,
across multiple settings, across people, and artifacts that may be physical and/or
ideational” (Lee, 2017, p. 95). The pandemic has made this question of development
and its complexities very clear.

12 The Impact of COVID-19 on a Fragile Education System …

319

The course development of the learner takes is thus vitally reliant upon sociocultural supports, tools, and mediations. The personal nature of development, furthermore, indicates that the affordances of supports, tools and the mediation provided
by teachers and parents must not only be accessible and available to all individuals
and communities, but must also be tailored to meet their individual needs (Stetsenko,
2017). As individual learners actively engage with their world and co-construct their
unique experiences, they require personalised supports that assist them in their development and academic performance. This is particularly necessary in South Africa
where we have an extremely diverse learner population that differs across race, class,
ethnic background, language, religion, and many other identities (Soudien, 2020a).
Using inequality as an example, we must address the ways in which stereotypes
regarding the experience of poverty are enacted in the lives of learners and in the
practices and organisation of schooling. It is not enough to use the social description of ‘white’ or ‘black’ to understand the learning experience of the child. Each
child is different. Tools must be developed to assist administrators and educators
in understanding how even curricula and teaching practices perpetuate stereotypical
perceptions of ability and of resources for coping. Such framings move us away from
deterministic explanations that are deficit-based instead of examining the ways in
which the sociocultural environment can support the functional human development
needs of all learners (see Lee, 2017). To illustrate the complexity of the learning
challenge for individual learners in South Africa, and the influence of COVID-19,
we refer to a case study carried out by Shafieka Isaacs (2020) during the lockdown
period.
Isaacs (2020) provides a narrative portrait of how Kabelo, a nine-year old boychild
in the second grade living in the Soweto township, navigated his learning experience
both before and during COVID-19. Through description of several contradictions
between Kabelo’s performance and behavior in academic and play spaces before
COVID-19, the author illustrates the intersection of persistent structural inequality
and the life of this individual learner. For example, within formal education Kabelo
is required to engage in monolingual teaching and learning as prescribed in the
curriculum. Based on his low literacy test scores, he was labelled as an academic
underperformer. However, outside of this domain Isaacs shows that he is, in real
terms, multilingual and capably navigates his world. He exercises agency and makes
responsible decisions. This contradiction, and others, suggest that the two systems—
home and school—are in conflict, with only the academic performance system
enjoying legitimacy while the knowledges and capabilities shown in the play system
are not recognised. Further contradictions and misrecognitions were identified under
lockdown when schools were shut down and Kabelo was restricted to his home. For
example, while he had the self-motivation to watch educational TV channels, engage
in learning through play, and complete the limited homework his mother collected for
him from the school, his actual experience, including the agency he demonstrated,
was not observed, and acknowledged by his school. Deemed to be underperforming,
there is contradiction between how Kabelo attempted to continue his learning and
the lack of communication and guidance he received (Isaacs, 2020).

C. Soudien et al.

Kabelo’s case, we argue, is illustrative of what we need to understand much more
fully. It is argued here that how learners are individually positioned, located, and
enabled to manage their learning is of the utmost importance. A socially-just education system is one which not only recognises the differing social circumstances of
learners but is also attentive to their learning dynamics and responds with inclusive policy, pedagogy, and curricula. Kabelo is the subject of social and systemic
inequality—he is black and is a learner in a disadvantaged part of the schooling
system—but he is also disadvantaged by the lack of recognition of his individual
capacities and capabilities. This latter point is of particular significance.
The literature on learning and cognition is now clear, diminished opportunities
for stimulation—through poverty of opportunity, the presence of trauma (and we
would argue that switching from mother-tongue to learning in English is an example
of trauma), and the lack of nutritional food—precipitate hormonal responses in
learners which negatively impacts neurocognitive development, potential educational
achievements, and ultimately upward societal mobility (see, inter alia, Farah, 2010;
World Bank, 2018). The example of Kabelo raises the necessity for further interdisciplinary research to develop evidence-based education that can provide individualised
answers for learners without losing human relationships and interaction which are
equally necessary for learning (Nóvoa and Alvim, 2020).

12.8 Conclusion
Although we cannot state categorically to what extent learning losses have taken
place and their scale, we can speculate broadly that this has happened. It is also likely
learning loss has been experienced disproportionately by those who are vulnerable
and less able to draw on the resources of the system. Privileged children are more able,
except those with challenging learning differences, to susbtitute for the shortcomings
of an education system and will arguably return to their academic trajectory with
relative ease. COVID-19 has thus laid bare both the inequalities in provisions needed
to continue learning from home—such as funds, digital devices and data, adequate
nutrition—as well as the disparity in how well teachers, learners, and parents have
been equipped to do so. Even though many countries struggle with this divide, the
distinctiveness of the South African experience is the fragility of its educational
system and its capacity to deal with shocks such as COVID-19. While we have
seen a slow improvement, it is clear that the system may not be able to sustain the
gains it has made. Instead, as Gustafsson (2020b: 3) has shown, fragility is evident
in the very drivers of the country’s improvements—improved access to materials,
improved household incomes, improved access to nutrition. All these drivers of
development have been challenged by COVID-19. In its response to the pandemic,
the government has struggled simply to keep the system operational. It has not, as
better resourced and better established school systems have, been able to improvise,
innovate and experiment in response to COVID-19. As we suggest in our speculation
using the TIMSS data, the country is in danger of being set-back in its improvement

trajectory by five years. As even this first attempt at making sense of the COVID-19
educational experience reveals, the South African educational system and the most
prevalent educational approaches being implemented are not sufficiently robust and
innovative to deal with the first order of business of stabilising the system, let alone
the challenges of innovating towards greater equality.

COVID-19 and U.S. Schools: Using Data
to Understand and Mitigate Inequities
in Instruction and Learning
Laura S. Hamilton and Kadriye Ercikan

Abstract Shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in the United States, schools
across the country had to enact significant, rapid changes to their instructional models,
and schools varied widely in their access to the resources needed to support these
efforts. Researchers across the U.S. quickly launched surveys, website reviews, and
other data-collection methods to document these shifts. In this chapter, we draw
on this research to describe the U.S. K-12 educational context, the policies states
adopted, the practices and resources schools offered, and the potential effects on
students’ academic, social, and emotional learning. In these discussions we draw
particular attention to inequities in educational opportunities across schools serving
different student populations. We then discuss how different sources of data will be
needed to help identify educational needs and mitigate disparities in instruction and
learning post-pandemic.

13.1 Introduction
In the U.S., the announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic by the World Health Organization in early March 2020 brought the significance of this health crisis to national
attention. A combination of factors, including a fractured media landscape, low levels
of trust in institutions, and lack of coordinated messaging across different levels
of government resulted in widespread disagreement among Americans about the
severity of the pandemic and how they should respond to it (Ipsos, 2020; Kavanagh,
2020). Moreover, there was slow recognition of the pandemic as a national emergency and limited guidance for and attention to the unprecedented disruption in all
sectors of society, including education.
This lack of clear, centralized guidance, combined with the U.S. education
system’s history of local control and the substantial differences in access to resources
across schools and districts, led to wide variation in how schools responded to the
pandemic (Audrain et al., This volume). Understanding these responses is crucial for

informing future efforts to address the educational harms caused by the disruption to
learning. Fortunately, researchers, education advocates, and others across the U.S.
quickly launched data-collection activities to document schools’ responses and the
effects of the pandemic on educators and learners. These data will play an essential
role in helping policymakers and practitioners identify what interventions and other
resources need to be provided and which groups of learners have the most urgent
need for these resources.
In this chapter, we draw on several of these data sources to describe (1) the K-12
educational context in the United States when the pandemic hit and state policies
and guidelines for remote learning, (2) how school closures and shift to remote
learning impacted students and teachers, and (3) the ways that data can help identify
educational needs and inform policy and practice to mitigate disparities in instruction and learning.1 The large number of data-collection efforts undertaken in the
wake of the first school closures have provided timely and crucial information about
the pandemic’s effects. We do not attempt to review all these data sources for this
chapter.2 Instead, we draw on a small number of them to highlight some themes
that are especially relevant to understanding the pandemic’s effects on educational
opportunities.
These data allow us to paint a broad picture of the pandemic’s effects on educators
and students and to identify potential sources of inequity. As we discuss throughout
the chapter, however, the available data are insufficient for developing a thorough
understanding of how the pandemic affected students’ learning opportunities and
how it is likely to affect their social, emotional, and academic development. The
final section of this chapter builds on what we learned about the utility of existing
data on responses to the pandemic in the U.S., offering guidance for policymakers
and others to promote a more comprehensive strategy for tracking inequities in the
short and longer terms.

13.2 The U.S. Public Education Context and Policy
Response to COVID-19
To make sense of schools’ responses to the pandemic, along with the challenges they
faced in pivoting to new instructional delivery models, it is important to understand
the broader policy context and education landscape in which public schools in the
United States were operating. Since the founding of the U.S. public education system,
the federal role in influencing school policies and operations has been limited. Instead,
1 Although this chapter focuses on K-12 public schooling in the United States, the pandemic significantly disrupted other educational institutions including colleges and universities (see https://www.
crpe.org/sites/default/files/final_ep_postsecondary_synthesis.pdf for a discussion of implications
of the pandemic for postsecondary education).

state and local (i.e., district) agencies and school boards have primary responsibility
for setting school policy. Moreover, systems of school funding rely heavily on state
and local taxes, resulting in substantial inequities in school funding that favor schools
in wealthier communities (Baker & Corcoran, 2012; Ercikan & Elliott, 2015). Thus,
when COVID-19 arrived on American shores, students were already experiencing
unequal educational opportunities, with students of color and those from low-income
families having less access to high-quality learning opportunities than other students
(National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2019).
These pre-existing inequities and the lack of a strong federal role in education
provide important background for understanding the pandemic’s effects. In the next
section we briefly describe relevant aspects of the educational context as the pandemic
started disrupting education, including school and family access to technology that
could support remote learning. We then summarize the instructional policies that
states, districts, and schools adopted in response to this disruption. This overview is
intended to lay the groundwork for the subsequent discussion of the impact of the
pandemic on instruction learning.

13.2.1 Educational Context in the Early Phases
of the Pandemic
Policies regarding when and how to shift operations in response to COVID-19 varied
greatly across states and school districts in the U.S. Starting the second week of March
2020, schools on the East Coast of the U.S. closed their buildings and transitioned
to remote learning. Within a few weeks, school closures expanded to other parts of
the country, resulting in closures of at least 124,000 of the estimated 132,000 U.S.
public and private schools. These closures were expanded through the end of the
2020 academic year in 48 states and affected over 50 million public school students
(Education Week, 2020).
The sudden transition to remote learning3 has been marked by disparities among
schools. Schools in the poorest neighborhoods experienced the most significant challenges in moving to remote teaching and learning, exposing deep inequities that exist
in the American education system. Examples of such challenges were observed in the
state of Michigan. In this state, school districts were given flexibility of implementing
different forms of remote learning, including delivering learning and instruction
through cell phones, online classes, and by mailing materials to homes. In Detroit,
one of the poorest school districts in Michigan and in the country, when schools
closed in March, nine out of 10 students lacked access to digital devices (e.g., tablets
or computers) and also lacked internet access (Associated Press Wire Content, 2020).

3 Throughout this chapter, we use the phrase “remote learning” to refer to schools’ provision

of instructional materials and learning supports (including online instruction) outside the school
building. Remote learning is sometimes referred to as “distance learning” or “distance education.”.

The severity of the challenge was recognized by the state, which invested $23 M to
get 51,000 Detroit students tablets by late April.
In addition to access to digital devices for remote learning, access to the internet
has been another significant barrier to learning opportunities. Lack of internet access
is not rare in the U.S. In February 2020, shortly before the first known cases of
the pandemic in the U.S., the BroadbandNow research estimated that 42 million
Americans did not have access to internet (Busby & Tanberk, 2020). Nationwide,
13% -26% households did not have access to internet in major cities in the U.S., with
Memphis (26%) at the top, and New York city (13%) at the bottom. The combination
of access to devices and internet can magnify the challenge of delivering instruction
and learning to students at home.
As expected, the challenges associated with device and internet access affected
school districts serving large proportions of low-income students at greater levels
than other districts. Education Week conducted a survey of 2,600 teachers and school
district leaders, first during the period of March 24–25, and a second round on April
7–8. The survey findings indicate enormous differences between school contexts that
serve low-income students and others. In particular, 64% of school district leaders
in school contexts with 75% or higher percentage of students from low-income
backgrounds reported that technology access was a major problem, compared to
21% of district leaders in school contexts with 25% or fewer low-income students
(March 24–25, 2020 data).4

13.2.2 Policies for Remote Learning
In April 2019, the Center on Reinventing Public Education (CRPE) reviewed information provided on district websites for 100 districts across the country (Dusseault,
Heyward, Jochim, & Pillow, 2020). These districts served close to 10 million students,
covered 50 states and 7 U.S. territories, and included the 30 largest districts in
the country.5 Within a month of the COVID-19 pandemic this review revealed that
even though the states made efforts to provide guidance and resources to districts,
they fell short of providing clear expectations or adequate instructional resources to
support remote learning or to remediate lost learning opportunities. Fifteen out of 50
states provided no directives requiring remote learning, leaving plans up to the local
districts. In 29 states, state departments of education required districts to provide
remote learning. However, little to no guidance or instruction was given for what
4 These statistics are based on an online survey conducted by Education Week (https://www.

edweek.org/technology/the-disparities-in-remote-learning-under-coronavirus-in-charts/2020/04?
print=1). Specific details about the sampling and weighing are unavailable. Our inclusion of data
from this survey is intended to demonstrate the severity of the differences in some contexts, but the
results should not be interpreted as being nationally representative.
5 CPRE has continued to update this database and expanded it to include a nationally representative sample of 477 districts: https://www.crpe.org/publications/getting-back-school-update-plansacross-country.

was meant by remote learning. For example, Maryland required districts to provide
remote learning but did not define what “remote learning” should include. Iowa
removed requirements for instruction as long as districts provided a plan for “any
methodology used to extend learning beyond brick-and-mortar district building.”
Half of the districts in CRPE’s review did not require any remote learning plans.
In keeping with the long tradition of state and local control in the U.S. public education system, there was great variation in states’ approaches to providing guidance on
what kinds of learning experience districts must offer. For example, the state education agency in Delaware required districts to provide detailed plans for their remote
learning, including number of hours and days, by grade. A less directive approach
was followed by the Alabama Department of Education, which provided a checklist
of instructional delivery options, their curriculum providers, and the mechanisms of
instruction.
CRPE’s review showed lack of clear guidance by state departments of education
on remote learning, along with lack of centralized efforts in providing resources for
supporting districts and schools in most states. This context, combined with existing
disparities in education resources and the societal inequities in general, created a
perfect storm for school-level decision-makers. In the next section, we summarize
data on instruction and learning, beginning with a description of the opportunities
schools provided for students to learn during the pandemic.

13.3 Impact of COVID-19 on Instruction and Learning
in U.S. K-12 Schools
Although many of the short-term–and certainly the longer-term–impacts of the
COVID-19-induced disruptions to education remain to be seen, early data suggest
numerous troubling signs. The pandemic affected virtually all the nation’s K-12
students in some ways, and its effects are likely to be especially pronounced for groups
of students who have been underserved by the education system in the past, given
the longstanding, systemic inequities that had deprived these students of resources
available to their more-advantaged peers.
In this section, we first summarize data on how opportunities for students to participate in education changed as a result of the pandemic, focusing on public schools
serving students in grades kindergarten through twelve. We also present some data on
how responsibilities for provision of instruction shifted from institutions to families
and discuss potential implications of this shift for equity. We then discuss research
that provides suggestive, early evidence on how these disruptions to schooling might
have affected student learning. We conclude this section by exploring likely longerterm effects on students’ learning and well-being. Although we focus this discussion
on instructional opportunities, it is important to recognize that schools in the U.S.
provide social services, including meal provision and mental and physical healthcare,
and that schools also serve as many families’ childcare providers. We do not address

these aspects of schooling due to space limitations, but they are important considerations for understanding the pandemic’s broader effects on schools, students, and
families.

13.3.1 Opportunities to Learn During Widespread School
Closures
Shifts in Instruction during COVID-19
In the early phases of the pandemic, in addition to variations in access to digital
devices and internet, there was significant variation in how teachers engaged and
interacted with students online (Herold, 2020). Based on the Education Week survey,
only 67% of teachers in schools serving high percentages of low-income students
were engaging in any kind of instruction during school closures in March, whereas
in schools with less than 25% low-income students, 89% of teachers engaged in
instruction.6 By April, in all school settings instruction increased, though the disparities between lower-income schools and others remained. The lower rates of online
instruction were accompanied by lower rates of in-person instruction and online
opportunities for learning for low-income schools (see Fig. 13.1).
The rapid shift to remote learning and the lack of universal access to technology
almost certainly resulted in changes in curriculum coverage and other features of
typical school-based instructional programs. Indeed, fewer than half of school principals reported having a plan in place pre-pandemic to deal with prolonged school
closures, and many lacked other supports for remote learning, such as online learning
6 As noted earlier, the data from the EdWeek survey are intended to describe inequities in learning

opportunities or resources, but they should not be interpreted as national representative.

333

management systems or relevant teacher training (Diliberti, Schwartz, Hamilton, &
Kaufman, 2020).7 Even after schools shifted to remote learning, both teachers and
principals reported significant gaps in training and other supports for remote learning,
and they were especially in need of additional training to support students with
disabilities and other groups with special needs (Hamilton, Kaufman, & Diliberti,
2020).
The near-universal closures of schools to in-person learning in spring 2020 was
followed in fall 2020 by a variety of instructional delivery models. Some schools
continued to provide fully remote instruction while others opened to fully in-person
learning, at least temporarily. Hybrid models in which students split their time
between in-person and remote learning became common, and in some schools,
students or their families could choose from among various modes. Because of
the planning and resources required to engage in fully in-person or hybrid models,
students in under-resourced schools were less likely to have those opportunities
(Diliberti & Kaufman, 2020). Data from RAND’s American Educator Panels reveal
that smaller percentages of schools serving high proportions of low-income students
(regardless of racial/ethnic composition) and those serving high proportions of
students of color offered hybrid or fully in-person options compared with the full
sample of schools (see Fig. 13.2).
Although we lack detailed national data on teachers’ pedagogical practices or
the content they covered during the pandemic, survey data provide some evidence
regarding the basic features of that instruction. In surveys administered at various time
points during the pandemic, teachers reported that they spent more time reviewing
old content and less time presenting new content than they had in the past, they
were less likely to assign letter grades or provide feedback on student work, they
interacted with their students less, and they were unable to reach all of their students
or students’ families (Diliberti & Kaufman, 2020; Hamilton, Kaufman, & Diliberti,
2020; Kurtz, 2020; Lieberman, 2020). Only 12% of teachers reported in spring 2020
that they were able to cover all or most of the curriculum they would have covered
had schools remained open, suggesting the potential for widespread gaps in student
knowledge and skill development (Hamilton et al., 2020).
Reviews of school and district websites provide additional information about
instruction during the pandemic. These websites are often a primary means of
communicating with all stakeholder groups and can shed light on factors such as
scheduling, grading policies, digital tools adopted, and attendance-tracking methods.
An analysis of a nationally representative sample of school websites (Harris et al.,
2020) found that the extent of schools’ personalization and engagement (e.g., use of
live, synchronous instruction, provision of feedback on student work) was positively
associated with local internet access but did not relate to schools’ racial/ethnic composition or socioeconomic status. The district website review by CRPE shows some

principals to survey questions about practices, working conditions, and other policy-relevant topics.

were asked to select from the following response options: “Fully remote instruction, where a large

instruction, where a large majority or all students receive less than one synchronous class each
school day (i.e., instruction might be distributed via paper workbooks or asynchronous videos)”;
“Hybrid model, where a majority or all students receive some in-person instruction and some remote
instruction”; and “Fully in-person instruction each school day for the majority, if not all, students.”

system-level conditions that are aligned with school staff survey responses, particularly regarding inadequate resources and supports for vulnerable student populations
including students with disabilities (CRPE, undated). Their longitudinal analysis
indicated that districts’ strategies and resources improved from spring to fall 2020
but that districts continued to struggle to provide technology and keep track of all
their students. An additional concerning set of statistics comes from a separate review
of school district websites that estimated lost instructional time (Malkus, 2020). The
study found that between March 2020 and the end of the 2019–2020 school year,
students in the most economically disadvantaged districts lost 20 days of instruction
on average, and even the most economically advantaged lost 16 days during the same
period. This lost time was due to a combination of cancelled instructional days and
student nonparticipation in instruction.
Together, the data summarized above point to widening opportunity gaps across
schools. But because these data do not provide information about differences in
students’ experiences within schools or classrooms, we are unable to assess the full
impact of the pandemic on inequity. Even within the same classroom, some students
will have received higher-quality instruction than others due to factors such as their
ability to access remote instruction from home or their opportunities to study in

13 COVID-19 and U.S. Schools: Using Data to Understand and Mitigate …

335

quiet, sufficiently spacious environments. We return to the need for better data on
within-school differences later in this chapter.
Addressing Educators’ Needs
Both teachers and principals have reported needing a wide range of supports for
teaching and learning during the pandemic, including additional resources related
to both academic instruction and broader student and educator well-being. One of
the most significant needs, according to teachers, was strategies to keep students
engaged and motivated to participate in remote learning, as shown in Fig. 13.3.
Sizable percentages of teachers also expressed a major need for strategies to address
the loss of hands-on learning opportunities, guidance or tools for assessing students’
social and emotional well-being, and tools and resources to enable counselors or
school psychologists to support students. Moreover, 68 percent of teachers reported
that the well-being of their students was an area of major concern, and another 26
percent described it as a moderate concern (Hamilton et al., 2020). These responses
demonstrate that teachers’ concerns for their students extend well beyond academic

performance. Many teachers also indicated a need for assessments, both for academic
achievement and social and emotional well-being.
Interest in student well-being was not limited to teachers. In spring 2020, principals were more likely to report at least a “major need” for SEL instructional materials
than for academic materials (Hamilton & Opfer, 2020). And 60% of district leaders
in the fall 2020 American School District Panel Survey reported that addressing
students’ SEL and mental health needs was an area for which they had the greatest
need for support–higher than any of the other needs included in the survey (Schwartz
et al., 2020). Addressing students’ SEL needs can be especially challenging when
opportunities for in-person interaction and relationship-building are so limited. Elimination of non-academic activities such as classroom parties or extracurricular activities has understandably received less attention than changes to academic instruction,
but these can be a valuable source of social, emotional, and academic development, and their absence in students’ school lives results in additional missed learning
opportunities.
It is important to recognize that teachers’ capacity to support their students is
influenced by teachers’ own well-being (Hamilton & Doss, 2020; Oberle & SchonertReichl, 2016), and surveys suggest that the pandemic harmed teachers’ well-being in
several ways. Majorities of teachers surveyed in spring 2020 identified the following
factors as areas of moderate or major concern: their own health or the health of
loved ones (75%), responsibilities to care for their own children or other loved ones
(59%), and feelings of burnout (54%) (Hamilton et al., 2020). By fall 2020, a full
80% of teachers reported burnout as a moderate or major concern, and roughly one
quarter reported that they were likely to leave the teaching profession (Diliberti
& Kaufman, 2020). As the pandemic dragged on, its negative effects on teachers’
well-being continued to mount, as evidenced by the three-quarters of teachers who
reported in an EdWeek survey of 817 teachers in November 2020 that their morale
was lower than before the pandemic (Will, 2021). School principals, too, reported
struggling with low morale and anxiety (Brackett, Cannizzaro, & Levy, 2020). It will
be important for those who support schools to keep these data in mind and recognize
the value of addressing the well-being of both students and educators.
What Families are Saying
Considering the growing role that families have played in providing time and space
for schooling, if not delivering instruction themselves, any predictions about educational effects of the pandemic would be incomplete without considering the challenges facing families. Surveys of families have revealed widespread concerns about
students falling behind in school, and those whose children attended school partly
or fully remotely were more likely to express these concerns than parents whose
children received in-person instruction (see Jochim, Gundapaneni, & Pangelinan,
2020, for a synthesis of numerous family surveys).
These concerns are undoubtedly attributable in large part to the challenges families and students have encountered. The Understanding America Study, a nationally
representative household pulse survey project, has tracked the perceptions of K12 students’ families, finding that access to supports such as devices and internet

13 COVID-19 and U.S. Schools: Using Data to Understand and Mitigate …

337

improved from spring to fall 2020 but that many students still lacked access to a
device they could use consistently or to reliable internet service (Saavedra, Rapaport, & Silver, 2020). This was especially the case for students of color and those
in low-income households. In addition, although majorities of parents were satisfied
with the instruction their children’s schools provided, parents of students of color and
lower-income students reported greater concerns about several aspects of schooling,
including access to social supports, than other parents (Jochim, Gundapaneni, &
Pangelinan, 2020).
Among families of students whose schools were not offering fully in-person
instruction, more than ten percent reported participating in “learning pods”–groups
of students who learn together with support from one or more family members, tutors,
or teachers. These pods have the potential to further exacerbate inequities, especially
if more-affluent families have better access to networks and resources to support
pods. However, the practice was more commonly reported by less-affluent families
(Saavedra, Rapaport, & Silver, 2020). Many families have also switched schools or at
least considered doing so, and again we see gaps, with affluent families more likely
to consider private schools or full homeschooling and less-affluent families more
likely to enroll students in charter schools. These changes to students’ learning environments and the accompanying differences by race or economic status complicate
efforts to monitor students’ learning opportunities and mitigate opportunity gaps.

13.3.2 Likely Short-Term Effects of the Pandemic on Student
Outcomes
The previous discussion highlighted the substantial challenges that schools faced and
the widespread disparities in students’ opportunities to participate in high-quality
educational environments. Even if schools returned to their pre-pandemic status by
the start of the 2021–2022 academic year, some scholars predicted that the effects of
the missed learning opportunities in spring 2020 and during the 2020–2021 school
year will result in long-term, if not lifelong, disadvantage for the generation of K-12
students who experienced the pandemic (OECD, 2020). Our ability to understand
effects on students’ academic learning and other outcomes is limited by a lack of
high-quality data in addition to the short timeline, but evidence from earlier work on
topics such as online learning and effects of natural disasters provides some basis for
speculating about what is likely to happen, and more recently gathered data offers
an early look at the pandemic’s effects.
What we Can Infer from Pre-Pandemic Student Achievement Data
The unprecedented nature of COVID-19’s impact on schools across the U.S.
precludes any effort to draw strong inferences about likely effects on learning from
pre-pandemic data. The most relevant evidence comes from two bodies of research
on conditions that share at least one feature with the current context. First, scholars

338

L. S. Hamilton and K. Ercikan

have turned to data on students’ academic achievement trajectories over summer
break to predict what might happen to students who receive no instruction for weeks
or months (Kuhfeld et al., 2020). Recent research suggests that differences in summer
learning are not as great a contributor to racial/ethnic and socioeconomic achievement gaps as once thought (von Hippel & Hamrock, 2019) and that there is extensive
variation in summer learning trajectories that is not easily explained by measurable
demographic characteristics such as race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status (Atteberry & McEachin, 2020). In fact, the magnitude of this variation can exceed what is
seen during a typical school year (Kuhfeld et al., 2020). This work suggests that the
learning trajectories of individual students during school closures will differ substantially, but the sources of these differences are not clear from existing research. Of
course, most students received at least some instruction while schools were closed
in spring 2020, and even more did in fall 2020. Thus, the relevance of these summer
learning trends is somewhat limited.
A second data source that might be more relevant, particularly when it comes
to instructional delivery, is data gathered from students who participated in fully
virtual schooling. Research has consistently linked students’ participation in fully
virtual schools to lower rates of learning in several academic subjects, relative to
the performance of similar students attending in-person schools (Ahn & McEachin,
2017; Fitzpatrick et al., 2020; Woodworth et al., 2015). The reasons for these differences are not clear but are likely to stem in part from high student–teacher ratios
that limit students’ contact with teachers, challenges associated with monitoring and
promoting student engagement in learning, and the inability of students with special
needs to participate fully in online instruction (Gill et al., 2015). As we discussed
above, these concerns are similar to ones that have arisen during COVID-19 remote
learning, so the lessons from this body of research have clear relevance. At the same
time, the instructional models schools adopted in response to the pandemic are almost
certainly unlike the intentional, online-only models that most fully virtual schools
have adopted, and the virtual schooling sector tends to serve a group of students that
is not representative of the U.S. population of public-school students.
Kuhfeld and colleagues (2020) present additional relevant research on achievement effects of school absences, weather-related closures, and school disruptions
stemming from natural disasters. The findings generally indicate negative effects of
not being in school, but none of these situations closely match the COVID-19 context.
Moreover, the COVID-19 period coincided with the widely publicized Black Lives
Matter protests that brought significant attention to racial injustice. As Kuhfeld et al.
(2020) point out, past research on killings by police suggests reason to believe these
recent events could contribute to COVID-19’s negative effects on student achievement. Together, prior research points to a high probability of significant missed
learning opportunities resulting in lower achievement test scores than students would
have attained under more normal circumstances, but the magnitudes of these likely
effects, and their relationships with pre-existing achievement disparities, are unclear.

13 COVID-19 and U.S. Schools: Using Data to Understand and Mitigate …

339

What we are Learning from Early Data in the COVID-19 Era
Fortunately, data on how students are performing during COVID-19 are starting to
become available. Using NWEA MAP© Growth™ assessment data for approximately 4.4 million students, Kuhfeld and colleagues examined fall 2020 reading and
mathematics scores for students in grades three through eight, comparing them to
the scores of students in the same grades in fall 2019 (Kuhfeld et al., 2020b). Their
findings paint a somewhat more promising picture than the estimates discussed in
the previous section: students’ reading scores in fall 2020 were similar to those in
fall 2019, whereas their math scores were roughly 5–10 percentile points lower in
2020 than in 2019. The findings suggest students’ growth in math achievement was
lower during the 2019–2020 school year than it would have been in a typical year.
The authors note although the assessment was administered both remotely and inperson, there was a fairly high rate of missing data that disproportionately consisted
of students of color, those with relatively low prior achievement, and those in schools
that served large proportions of economically disadvantaged students. The likelihood
that these groups of students are the ones most vulnerable to negative effects of the
pandemic creates a reason to be less optimistic than the initial findings might suggest.
There is also evidence of negative effects on another measure of students’
academic performance: course grades for many students are lower than before
(Strauss, 2020). In addition, survey data make it clear that teachers have concerns
about their students’ learning. In the RAND fall American Teacher Panel survey, for
instance, approximately a quarter of teachers said that most of their students were
significantly less prepared to participate in grade-level work in fall 2020 than they had
been at the same time last year, and these percentages were higher in schools serving
majorities of students of color and economically disadvantaged students (Diliberti &
Kaufman, 2020). Given the continued impact of the pandemic on school operations
and the probable need for significant acceleration of learning to ensure that students
get back on track, it will be crucial to monitor achievement test scores, grades, and
other measures of student performance over the coming years.

13.3.3 Potential Longer-Term Effects on Student Learning
and Well-Being
The findings discussed above begin to fill in some of the gaps in our knowledge
about the pandemic’s effects, but what we do not yet know swamps what we do.
We have not yet been able to examine the learning trajectories for different groups
of students as conditions for learning in both schools and homes have shifted, and
we do not know how persistent the effects of the pandemic on academic learning
will be. Moreover, we know almost nothing about national and subgroup trends in
areas that are not measured by existing academic achievement tests, including social
and emotional learning as well as academic performance in non-tested subjects and
grade levels. Finally, much of the existing research relies on a small set of tests that

340

L. S. Hamilton and K. Ercikan

are particularly well-suited to examining learning trajectories but that do not capture
the full range of competencies that students typically develop in their mathematics
and reading classes.
Although these gaps in our knowledge make predictions difficult, existing data
provide reasons for both concern and optimism. The group disparities in learning
opportunities and outcomes discussed above are a source of significant concern:
Unless policies and funding are intensively targeted toward supporting the students
who suffered most from the effects of the pandemic, it is likely these disparities will
remain, with significant consequences for students’ opportunities to pursue highquality postsecondary education or rewarding careers once they complete their K-12
education. Beyond academics, these indicate the potential for negative effects not
just on students’ mental health and well-being, but that of educators as well.
Despite this relatively gloomy outlook, a few bright spots provide some reason to
believe that the pandemic could lead to better, more equitable learning opportunities
if we respond constructively to what we are learning. One reason for optimism is
that despite innumerable challenges, educators across the U.S. and at all levels of the
education system sprang into action to shift instructional models in significant ways
and with unprecedented speed (Hamilton & Opfer, 2020). The dedication that many
educators displayed, and their willingness to try new strategies for connecting with
their students, are promising signs for a post-pandemic education system–provided
teachers receive the necessary supports, including training and working conditions, to
sustain their work. These instructional shifts also spurred some innovations in remotelearning technologies along with increased attention to the factors that contribute to
effective remote learning, such as family engagement and high-quality assessments.
For instance, some educators experimented with breakout rooms in videoconferencing software or with virtual-reality platforms to facilitate small-group interactions
(Allen, 2020).
In addition, although remote learning did not work well for all students, in some
cases students appeared to perform better in their new home-learning settings and to
enjoy school more as a result of conditions like reduced distractions or increased flexibility (Gilman, 2020). Teens, in particular, fared better than we might have predicted,
according to a survey of approximately 1500 adolescents conducted in summer 2020
(Twenge et al., 2020). On average, these teens reported lower rates of loneliness and
depression, less use of social media, and more time spent sleeping and engaging
in activities with family members compared with pre-pandemic results–though, as
with all the data we have discussed in this chapter–results varied significantly by
respondent characteristics and should not be interpreted as evidence of a generally
salutary effect.
A final reason for hope is that when schools closed their doors and families lost
access to crucial supports, other community-based organizations such as afterschool
programs often stepped in to help, offering resources such as a summer learning
toolkit developed by the Denver Afterschool Alliance.8 Combined with the increased

family involvement in instruction, these connections might lead to a deeper appreciation among policymakers that schools cannot meet all students’ needs on their own
and that partnerships among families, schools, and other community organizations
should be prioritized as part of a strategy to ensure equity and opportunity for all.
These small silver linings in no way compensate for the significant, widespread
interruption to learning that most students experienced and that disproportionately
affected students who lacked access to well-resourced schools before the pandemic.
Up to this point, this chapter summarized what we have learned about COVID-19’s
effects on learning in the U.S. public school system. In the next section, we discuss
how the research and policy communities can contribute to better information and
solutions going forward.

13.4 Advancing Measurement and Data Systems
to Promote Equitable Opportunities in the Wake
of the Pandemic
The widespread loss of learning opportunities, combined with substantial disparities
in access to high-quality supports for learning and well-being, point to a need for both
continued monitoring of opportunities and outcomes along with a well-coordinated,
ambitious effort to ensure widespread access to needed supports for all students.
Providing a comprehensive overview of what these supports should be and how they
should be deployed is beyond the scope of this chapter, and we refer readers to other
sources of such guidance.9 We instead discuss a particular need that educators and
policymakers face as they attempt to recover from the wreckage of the pandemic–the
need for high-quality data to mitigate harms while creating new, improved learning
opportunities in the coming years.
The significant changes in when, where, and how learning occurs will have longterm effects even after the pandemic ends (Schwartz et al., 2020), and educators will
need new ways of monitoring learning in non-traditional settings, along with sources
of data that provide consistent information about student learning. As harmful as
COVID-19 has been to students, families, and educators, its effects on the educational
landscape provide an opportunity to rethink what and how we measure learning
opportunities and outcomes. In this final section of the chapter, we highlight some of
the most important ways in which measurement can be applied to promote equitable,
high-quality learning for all students.

Data on opportunity-to-learn (OTL) will be more important than ever given the
widespread shift to different modes of schooling (Marion, 2020). Efforts to address
students’ learning needs will require understanding the learning environments they
have experienced, both at school and elsewhere, and the gaps in their exposure to
grade-level content and other instructional supports. And data will need to reveal not
just between-school differences but also differences in students’ access to instruction
within schools and even within the same classroom.
Monitoring OTL requires ongoing collection of data on the kinds of instructional
activities in which students engage and the learning resources to which they have
access. The expansion of learning in digital environments is likely to continue to
influence instruction post-pandemic. An advantage of many digital learning environments is the explicit documentation of implemented curriculum and instruction
and the opportunities to observe student engagement in learning activities. For OTL
data to inform practice and policy, features of digital learning and student engagement will need to be systematically measured and analyzed at student, classroom,
and higher levels. In addition, the digital learning resources can be examined to identify the degree to which these resources covered targeted curriculum and learning
outcomes.
Another source of OTL data is documentation of student learning activities in the
log files that many software packages generate. Such log data can provide information about whether and when students log onto learning environments, how much
time they spend on different activities, and how they navigate through the learning
activities, among other types of engagement with the learning environment. All these
data about students’ interactions with learning tools can help evaluate the degree to
which and how students have been engaging in the digital learning resources on
an ongoing basis. In light of the earlier discussion of challenges related to student
engagement and access to remote instruction, such data could help policymakers and
education leaders target resources to the students who are most in need of additional
learning support.

13.4.2 Monitoring Learning Outcomes to Inform Policy
and Practice
In general, assessments at all levels need to be considered with their targeted uses
and impact in mind. In the current educational context, dire educational needs and
the role of assessment in meeting those needs should determine which, how, and
when assessments are conducted. Two educational needs are of primary relevance:
(1) the learning opportunity loss due to school closures; and (2) growing disparities
in learning outcomes for students from different racial/ethnic and socioeconomic

13 COVID-19 and U.S. Schools: Using Data to Understand and Mitigate …

343

backgrounds. We highlight key information requirements and the role of educational
assessments for both of these needs below.
Information needs and role of assessment for addressing learning opportunity losses
Currently we do not have adequate information about the degree of learning opportunity losses and how they varied across student groups and at individual student
levels. Addressing these losses requires actions at the individual student level as well
as the group and system levels. Accordingly, different types of assessment information are needed for these uses. In particular, to address individual student needs,
educators will benefit from assessment information that is tied to students’ ongoing
learning activities and that provides fine-grained information about how students
progress through the curriculum. Such an intended use is referred to as formative
assessment and requires the assessments to be closely tied to instruction both in terms
of what they assess but also with respect to when the assessment is conducted and
how the assessment information is used. Greater use of digital platforms for learning
and assessment can facilitate access to such types of assessments by teachers and
students. These can be in the form of well-designed assessment tasks that can be
embedded within learning activities.
In addition to formative uses of assessments, information is needed to inform
policy and planning at classroom, district, and state levels. Well-designed, largescale assessments at state levels can provide such information. Several aspects of
these assessments are critical in order to meet such goals. Ercikan and BarclayMcKeown (2007) identify five requirements in order for large-scale assessments to
guide educational policy and practice:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

assessments need to assess valued outcomes;
assessments need to be aligned with learning, instructional, and curricular goals;
assessments need to provide accurate estimates of student knowledge and
competencies;
reports of assessment results need to be informative and timely;
intended and unintended consequences of uses of assessment results need to be
important considerations (p. 58).

Each of these requirements gain heightened importance and meaning in the current
educational context as they are discussed below.
Valued learning outcomes. Focusing on valued learning outcomes such as problem
solving and critical thinking, instead of recall of factual knowledge, has been the
focus of great discussion in education for over several decades. In the current educational context, focus on these types of learning outcomes is important for effective
preparation of students for higher levels of learning, preparation for higher education
and careers. In addition, in light of the prevalence of misinformation and mistrust
of evidence about COVID-19, and other natural, societal and political phenomena
(Hamilton, Kaufman, & Hu, 2020; Kavanagh & Rich, 2018), other constructs such
as civic knowledge, skills, and dispositions have particular relevance.
Alignment. In the current pandemic context, alignment with learning, instruction,
and curricular goals requires a greater focus on OTL given the disparities in learning

344

opportunities. There is great research evidence that assessments that are not closely
aligned with instruction and learning opportunities do not provide valid evidence of
student learning (Ercikan, 2006; Moss, Pulin, Gee, Haertel & Young, 2008; Linn,
Baker & Dunbar, 1991). This alignment is critical if the assessments are to inform
and support learning.
Accuracy of measurement. Great disparities in opportunities to learn have added
challenges for assessment with respect to the range of knowledge and skills the
assessments need to cover and variations in student learning outcomes. These disparities require assessments to be adaptable for different levels of learning outcomes,
with difficulty levels appropriate for student levels, and to provide accurate and
generalizable information about student competencies.
Reporting of assessment results. Usefulness, interpretability, and timeliness of
reports are critical for informing policies for addressing the impact of learning
opportunity losses and closing disparities in learning outcomes. The reports need
to provide actionable information at different levels of the education system to identify the degree of impact of the learning opportunity losses, which student groups,
schools, and districts have been disproportionally impacted, at points in time in the
school year for effective implementation of the policies.
Intended and unintended consequences. The focus here should be on designing
assessments that will support intended consequences and avoid inappropriate interpretations and uses of assessment results, and therefore minimize unintended consequences. Informing strategies to mitigate learning losses should be the central focus
of large-scale assessments. One aspect of supporting the intended uses involves
assessments to allow comparisons of learning outcomes with previous years so that
educators can identify the greatest gaps in students’ knowledge and skill development. Having a pre-COVID-19 baseline will help users of the data understand the
effects of the pandemic while also providing helpful information for addressing
longstanding differences in performance.
Users of assessment data should be wary of ways in which assessment use can
lead to inaccurate inferences and to potential harms for students or educators. Use of
assessments for school or teacher accountability, in particular, has been associated
with negative effects on instruction as well as threats to the validity of inferences
that the scores will support (Ercikan & Barclay-McKeown, 2007; Koretz, 2008;
Stecher et al., 2018). In the current context, risks associated with accountability
uses of tests are exacerbated. An expert panel on assessment in the context of the
pandemic laid out several key principles, one of which was “do no harm” (Lake &
Olson, 2020). With disparities in digital device and internet access, in addition to
educational support resources, the focus should be on using assessments to support
learning and development of all students.
Those who mandate, administer, and use assessments must also consider the
unique threats to validity that the pandemic has created. As we discussed earlier,
efforts to track learning trajectories during the pandemic have been thwarted by
incomplete data from students, including those who were unable to access the assessment remotely or have been unable to attend school at all. Other concerns include
lack of validated approaches to assessing English learners, students with disabilities,

13 COVID-19 and U.S. Schools: Using Data to Understand and Mitigate …

345

or other students who need assessment accommodations, as well as potential security
threats to remote testing. A long-term investment in better assessment options will
be needed to accommodate future shifts in instructional models, but in the meantime,
users of test-score data will need to apply appropriate caution when interpreting the
results.

13.4.3 Monitoring Social and Emotional Learning
The concern that teachers, principals, and district leaders expressed about promoting
students’ social and emotional learning (SEL) reflect a widespread understanding
that all learning brings together aspects of students’ academic, social, and emotional
competencies (Aspen Institute, 2019). The expansion of instructional delivery into
new modes and new settings could have implications for students’ opportunities
to establish supportive relationships and to develop competencies such as teamwork
and self-regulation. A comprehensive approach to data collection to inform decisions
about teaching, learning, and resource allocation should include both academic and
SEL measures (Lake & Olson, 2020).
Selecting the right SEL measures and using them in ways that will benefit rather
than harm students, can be especially challenging due to the lack of widely available,
validated assessments, the minimal training most educators receive to assess SEL,
and a lack of clear guidance regarding how to use the results of assessments to
inform instruction (Hamilton & Schwartz, 2019). It can be especially difficult to
find SEL assessments that are appropriate for all students, regardless of cultural
background and other personal circumstances (Jagers et al., 2018). And of course,
the remote-learning context creates additional barriers to SEL assessment.
As with the other types of assessment discussed above, the shift to remote learning,
and the growing prevalence of digital instructional materials and communication
methods, creates opportunities to re-evaluate traditional approaches to monitoring
SEL. Informal data-collection practices such as regular individual check-ins between
teachers and students can provide information that teachers can use to inform their
decisions about SEL instruction while also enabling them to identify students who
might be in need of additional resources such as counselors or other mental-health
professionals. Educators have been creative about exploring new ways foster SEL,
such as by encouraging student collaboration and teamwork through monitored
breakout rooms in videoconferencing software. Moreover, a growing number of
digital instructional tools are available to promote and assess SEL (see, for example,
Zoo U10 ).
Beyond the resources provided to students, data on educators’ social and emotional
well-being is also crucial for monitoring educational opportunities. As we discussed
earlier, educators’ well-being can influence their instruction and can be associated
with attrition, so it is inherently linked to the quality of student learning opportunities.

Online tools such as peer learning communities can help mitigate the stress associated with teaching (especially but not only during a pandemic), and inexpensive
assessments approaches such as regular brief surveys can provide data on educators’
emotional well-being so that policymakers and education leaders can intervene as
needed.
It is important to monitor for mental-health problems in both students and educators, but this does not mitigate the need for asset-based, universal SEL that builds the
competencies that all students will need for success in school, the workplace, and the
broader community. Information about SEL should be gathered in an ongoing way
rather than only at the end of a course or semester, when it might be too late to intervene. Finding ways to build SEL data collection into existing tools and assessment
systems can help address time and resource constraints while providing educators
and policymakers with crucial information to inform their work.

13.5 Conclusion
COVID-19 caught nations–including the United States, the wealthiest nation in the
world-off guard in meeting the needs of their populations. As the schools closed,
along with workplaces and businesses, the impact of shutting down the education systems were felt not only in well-being of students and teachers and learning
outcomes, but in economies of all the countries. There is now much greater understanding and appreciation of the role of education in the development of children
that goes beyond learning and facilitating opportunities for parents to participate in
the labor market.
We propose data–on both student outcomes and learning opportunities-as key to
addressing the short-term and likely long-term impact of COVID-19 on learning
opportunity losses and on disparities in educational outcomes. As the modes and
forms of learning change over time, as does the concept of schooling, there is a need
for a continuous-improvement approach to trying out innovative data-collection and
assessment strategies, monitoring their utility, validity, and fairness, and modifying
them in response to evidence. Those who develop or deploy new assessments will
face growing pressure to document validity, reliability, fairness, and utility of scores
on these tests and to provide users of the data with supports and guidance to ensure
appropriate interpretations and uses.
This data-informed approach will require coordinated action on the part of several
groups. Policymakers and funders should explore ways to support both large-scale
data collection for monitoring purposes and smaller-scale assessments for formative,
instructional purposes, along with research and development to ensure that these data
produce the best-possible evidence. Educators must gather and use data in ways that
benefit all students, and organizations that support and train educators need to equip
them to do so. Furthermore, students should be encouraged to share their perspectives
and experiences. Thoughtful, judicious use of assessments that monitor students’
academic, social, and emotional learning, as well as their learning environments, can

be a cornerstone of a broader strategy to help the education system not only recover
from the pandemic, but thrive in the post-pandemic era.

Ambitious and Sustainable
Post-pandemic Workplace Design
for Teachers: A Portrait of the Arizona
Teacher Workforce
R. Lennon Audrain, Andrea E. Weinberg, Ashley Bennett, Joseph O’Reilly,
and Carole G. Basile
Abstract The professional lives of teachers are in an incredible upheaval as a result
of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has potential implications for the teaching profession and the workforce. The ambiguity of what schools will look like in the future and
growing disparities of children have teachers concerned that their jobs are more untenable than ever before. In this chapter, we examine the teaching workforce year into the
pandemic. We focus specifically on Arizona and explore whether teachers stayed in
the profession or exited during this time of uncertainty. Our analysis suggests that, to
date, the pandemic has not had a significant impact on an already dire labor market
in Arizona—classroom vacancies and teaching positions filled by under-qualified
individuals were no higher in January 2021 than in January 2020. We conclude by
arguing that, while focusing teacher recruitment may seem like a viable solution, it
alone is insufficient. Rather, in a post-pandemic world, we must build new structures
that increase teacher coordination and collaboration that leverage the expertise of
all educators, ultimately leading to better working and workplace conditions. This
critical examination begins to shed light on teaching, learning, and the preparation
for both as we move to a post-pandemic future.

14.1 Introduction
The vital importance of quality teachers is indisputable. Much has been written
about teacher shortage and the growing need for teachers not only in the United
States but across the globe (Evans et al., 2019; UNESCO, 2016). For many years,
all eyes have been on recruitment and retention, alternative pathways to teacher
preparation, and a decrease in the rigors of teacher preparation. However, with the
crisis of the pandemic also comes opportunity—opportunity to examine the working
conditions of teachers, the teaching profession, and the learning environment in new
ways. Vegas & Winthrop argue that we may be in a “leapfrog” moment (2020). At

Arizona State University, we envision the Next Education Workforce as our leapfrog.
A workforce that can deepen and personalize learning for students by building teams,
distributing expertise, increasing specializations, and creating more opportunities for
advancement. It is a time to leapfrog, to take advantage of the upheaval to put the
puzzle pieces back together in new ways, new shapes, and new formations. To begin,
it is critical that we examine what is happening with the education workforce—
understand the existing complexities of the teaching profession, acknowledge the
chaos of the pandemic, examine what has happened to teachers over the past year—
and think anew with urgency and creativity.

14.1.1 Portrait of the Pre-pandemic Teacher Workforce
Teachers play an influential role in society as well as in the lives of youth and caregivers. Unfortunately, the profession of teaching in the U.S. has faced some longstanding and menacing challenges that frequently serve to undermine its reputation.
Considerations such as rigorous training and licensing, favorable working conditions
related to demands and environments, substantial workplace agency, and relatively
high compensation are defining characteristics of the status of a profession. Ingersoll
and Collins (2018) note that while some individuals argue that “instill[ing] an ethos
of public service and high standards” (p. 200) among teachers is sufficient to elevate
the profession in the eyes of educators themselves as well as society, others maintain
that a mere shift in sentiment is simply not enough. Rather, transformations of the
characteristics that define the profession itself, including teachers’ organizational
and working conditions, are essential (Ingersoll & Collins, 2018). Emerick et al.
(2005) illustrate some of the current unfavorable working conditions teachers face
when they write, “teachers often are isolated in their classrooms, face overwhelming
noninstructional duties, have extremely limited opportunities for meaningful decision making, lack basic instructional materials, and perceive few opportunities for
advancement and growth” (para. 3). These impact the reputation of the teaching
profession in the eyes of society as well as from the perspectives of teachers, which
has far reaching implications for teachers and students alike. One salient consequence
is the nation-wide crisis in the U.S. with recruiting, training, and retaining individuals
to the teaching workforce (Robinson, 2017).
Recruitment to the teaching profession has faced sharp decreases in recent years.
Between 2010 and 2018, enrollment has declined by more than one-third (Partelow,
2019). Fewer than four percent of the 1.9 million high school graduates who took
R in 2015 reported that they wanted to be an educator (e.g., teacher, counthe ACT○
selor, or administrator) which is a drastic fall from seven percent of test takers who
responded similarly in 2010 (ACT, 2016). Beyond expanding the number of individuals who pursue a degree in education, there is an imperative to attract and support
a workforce that reflects the diversity of student demographics in the United States
(Carver-Thomas, 2018). According to a recent report from the National Academies of
Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, “there is growing and compelling evidence that

14 Ambitious and Sustainable Post-pandemic Workplace Design for Teachers …

355

teacher-student racial match has important effects on student outcomes” (NASEM,
2019, p. 87). In 2015–16, twenty percent of the teaching workforce was teachers
of color (Taie & Goldring, 2017). This percentage, however, is disproportionate to
the total percentage of students of color in schools in the United States, which has
increased to over fifty percent in recent years (NCES, 2016). Evidence suggests
that new teachers entering education are increasingly teachers of color and decreasingly white teachers, which is promising (Warner-Griffin et al., 2016). As one end
of the teacher labor market spectrum, our imperative to recruit and retain diverse
teachers—teachers of color as well as those from other underrepresented groups
(e.g., with disability, non-English first origin or primary language) that will make the
workforce more representative of the student population—is evident.
Teaching is described as a complex practice (Ball & Forzani, 2009), with roles
being multi-dimensional and unpredictable (Doyle, 1977). Some have described the
work as “highly improvisational and wholly context dependent” (Ball & Forzani,
2009, p. 503). Thus, teaching can be extremely daunting for novice teachers, who
are expected to support students to achieve the same outcomes as their expert counterparts. The pressure on teacher education is immense; it can either help to make the
case for, or inhibit, teaching’s status as a profession. Teacher education is accountable to its teacher candidates, to students, and to the public (Cochran-Smith et al.,
2018). Programs for teacher preparation must prepare its candidates for “work and
life, academic learning, human development, and social justice” (Hansen, 2008,
p. 12). Teacher education is tasked with equipping its candidates to enter one of
the largest workforces in the country. Indeed, this highly skilled work of teaching is
considerably “unnatural” (Jackson, 1986). That is, the work requires specialized and
professional training, as Ball and Forzani (2009) argue; executing carefully designed
learning experiences to groups of learners is not natural work. The complexity of
teaching, and by extension, teacher education, cannot be tackled in siloed universities and schools. Rather, university-based teacher education programs must create
hybrid spaces where “academic, school-based, and community-based knowledge
come together in less hierarchical and haphazard ways to support teacher learning”
(Zeichner et al., 2015, p. 124).
In the U.S., teacher certification criteria are determined at the state level, and
it is up to states to define what they consider traditional and alternative certification programs. Generally, traditional teacher certification requirements include
achieving a bachelor’s degree or higher and successfully completing a state-approved
teacher preparation program that includes subject- or content-specific coursework,
education coursework, a student teaching experience, and earning passing scores on
licensure exams. Alternative certification programs, on the other hand, still require
passing scores, but require fewer education-focused courses and shorter field experiences. University-based programs are more likely to include coursework and experiences that are associated with increased student achievement (Eduventures, 2001).
While findings have been mixed, several robust studies found favorable outcomes
for teachers who completed traditional teacher education programs and more positive outcomes for their students. Early career teachers who follow an alternative
route to teaching feel more prepared to successfully meet the expectations of their

356

R. L. Audrain et al.

teaching roles (Kee, 2012; NCCTQPA, 2007); however, the students of alternatively
certified teachers have lower achievement scores (Boyd et al., 2008; Clotfelter et al.,
2010; Constantine et al., 2009; Darling-Hammond et al., 2005). Further, traditionally prepared teachers are more likely to stay in the profession longer than those
who complete alternative programs (Boyd et al., 2008; Glass, 2008; Kane et al.,
2006). One implication is that if teachers are better prepared for “usual” teaching,
they are likely to more successfully handle stressors like the COVID-19 pandemic.
Another implication is the need to recognize that individuals who enter the profession through these alternative routes would benefit from systems and structures (e.g.,
teaming) that offer scaffolds for these early-career teachers, who had narrower theoretical backgrounds and fewer experiences in classrooms prior to formally entering
the profession.
Additionally, the contemporary teacher workforce faces challenges with retention.
With an annual turnover rate of 16%, it is estimated that 8% of teachers leave the
profession and 8% change schools every school year (Carver-Thomas & DarlingHammond, 2017). If the 8% of teachers who leave the profession annually could
be reduced by at least half, the national teacher shortage could be nearly eliminated
(Sutcher et al., 2016). Teachers of color face turnover rates at a significantly higher
rate (24%) than their white counterparts (Ingersoll & May, 2011). These challenges
with retention can be largely attributed to factors related to working conditions,
including the demands on and environment for teachers. Teachers consistently decide
to leave the profession for similar reasons: lack of autonomy, pressures from testing
accountability, large class sizes, lack of administrative support, dissatisfaction with
teaching assignments, too few opportunities for advancement within the profession,
and/or inadequate salaries (Adamson & Darling-Hammond, 2011; Boyd et al., 2005;
Carver-Thomas & Darling-Hammond, 2017; Farinde et al., 2016).
The comprehensive environment for teaching and learning are also important
elements of working conditions. The demands of teaching are only exacerbated
by teachers operating in environments of structural isolation. Described as “eggcrates”, their instructional responsibilities are in one-teacher, one-classroom models
(Lortie, 1975). Despite the potential benefits of positive collaborative relationships
across the teacher’s career (e.g., Le Cornu, 2013), structural, administrative, relational, and conceptual barriers thwart teacher collaboration (Achinstein, 2002; Jao &
McDougall, 2016; Johnson, 2003; Zimmerman, 2006). Efforts to encourage teacher
collaboration have rarely attended to each of these aspects. Beyond removing structural and administrative barriers, teachers must learn to collaborate closely with other
educators whose backgrounds and experiences may be unlike their own, leveraging
the varied personal and professional experiences as assets to best meet the needs of
students (Boveda & Weinberg, 2020; Weinberg & Boveda, 2021).
In addition to the environments of isolation, differentiation and advancement in
one’s career is limited within the teaching profession. Historically, teaching has
been an “unstaged occupation with few opportunities to access higher earning and
higher status positions” (Natale et al., 2013, p. 5). Hierarchies within schools in
the U.S. remain flat—meaning duties, roles, privileges, and supports are similar for
all teachers, regardless of experience or aspiration to advance (Coggins, 2010). For

14 Ambitious and Sustainable Post-pandemic Workplace Design for Teachers …

357

example, novice teachers are given the same teaching load as experienced teachers.
Rigorous teacher education supports the development of teachers who are prepared
to engage in the multifaceted work of teaching, the time constraints of initial teacher
education and the broad scope of teaching practice that must be imparted through
it (Ball & Forzani, 2009) can make accomplishing all the aforementioned activities
difficult. While educator induction programs are required, there is tremendous variation in the quality, duration, and aims of such programs (Ronfeldt & McQueen,
2017), and only a small proportion of beginning teachers receive access to robust
early career supports through these programs (Sutcher et al., 2016). While important, without shifting the demands of novice teachers, induction is a time-consuming
obligation that is often not individualized to the specific needs of novice teachers and
may serve to have counterproductive side effects that burden teachers, rather than
offer them scaffolding to support the transition from teacher education to classroom
teacher (Kelchtermans, 2019). Indeed, if early career teachers were to join an established and cohesive team of educators, their assets could be leveraged while they are
simultaneously gaining professional support from more experienced teachers. For
more experienced teachers who want to advance in the education profession, they
find themselves with few options that allow them to maintain regular engagement
in the work of teaching students. Instead, career advancement within the traditional
educational systems is administrative or teacher-support roles that position individuals outside of classrooms. Teachers who want to advance, either for financial reasons
or for a variation in their daily role and responsibilities, find few opportunities within
current school structures.
The disparity between public school teacher wages and those of other college
graduates exists across the U.S. and is greater in Arizona than in any other state
(Allegretto & Mishel, 2016). Coupled with decades-long decreases in relative salaries
(Allegretto & Mishel, 2016; NCES, 2019), and yearly increases in unreimbursed
purchases by teachers to supplement their classroom budgets (García, 2019), it would
be unsurprising to find teachers feeling compelled to leave the profession as a result
of being unappreciated and unsupported.
The instability of teaching as a profession is a result of its workforce conditions and, by extension, the education workforce’s design. In function and form,
teaching was, pre-pandemic, untenable and will continue to be post-pandemic
without dramatic shifts. Teachers are now even more isolated than ever, delicately
balancing content delivery and caring for students’ socio-emotional needs, facing
top-down decision making, and transitioning to new instructional modalities with
little support.
In this chapter, we outline some of the escalating expectations for teachers in the
United States and paint a portrait of Arizona’s education workforce as examples of
a larger crisis with the education profession—a crisis that has left states, including
Arizona, with dramatic shortages of qualified teachers in K-12 classrooms. Working
conditions must change. Schools must find ways to increase collaboration among
teachers, leveraging their varied knowledge, skills, backgrounds, and embodied experiences by structuring their work on teams. As students return to physical schooling,
they need personalized learning experiences not only to address gaps in academic

358

R. L. Audrain et al.

instruction, but also to provide attention to their socio-emotional needs. In creating
and implementing these carefully crafted learning experiences, collaborative teams
of educators must have the autonomy to do what is best for students. The postpandemic future is unclear, but one thing is certain: our systems cannot return to the
way they were before.

14.1.2 Escalating Expectations for Teachers: Pre-pandemic
The complexities of teaching practice are coupled with working conditions replete
with increasing curricular and pedagogical expectations, non-instructional demands,
external pressures, and isolating working environments that contribute to the untenable nature of the job of teaching. These pervasive issues have existed for decades,
but increasingly, teachers are asked to do more and for more students. While not
exhaustive, the issues detailed below are some of the escalating expectations that
teachers have faced for the last two decades since the inception of No Child Left
Behind.
Pedagogical and curriculum requirements, providing students with a more holistic
learning environment and experience, and accountability systems have been at the
forefront of educators’ escalating expectations in recent years. There have been
tensions between the curricula and pedagogies—and the sheer number of individuals
with the expert knowledge, skills, and dispositions required to deliver learning experiences—that address “new” standards which emphasize interdisciplinarity, inquiry,
and open-ended problem solving (e.g., Common Core State Standards, Next Generation Science Standards). Recent increased attention to embracing diversity and
adopting culturally responsive or sustaining pedagogies (Gay, 2002; Paris, 2012)
is a favorable shift, as more educators have realized the importance of appreciating
students varied experiences, languages, and cultures. By engaging students’ experiences, languages, and cultures, educators effectively deepen learning experiences
and connect complex academic experiences to their students’ identities (Bitter &
Loney, 2015). Deeper learning experiences facilitated through the enactment of assetoriented pedagogies are good for all students. This, however, means that teachers must
abandon long-standing—and perhaps deeply ingrained—pedagogies and practices
that marginalize or even exclude students entirely, and replace these with those that
affirm students’ languages and cultures to engage all students in meaningful and
relevant learning activities.
External control mechanisms under the guise of accountability (Ingersoll, 2009)
are also important factors that influence teachers’ perceptions of the expectations
placed upon them and their working conditions—their demands and environments.
The outcomes and measures used to assess quality teaching are often made outside of
the control of the teaching profession (Evetts, 2009). While teachers themselves have
little control over key decisions regarding curriculum and accountability, teachers
have been vilified; they have been blamed for declines in student academic achievement, implicated as a threat the United States’ economic competitiveness as students’

14 Ambitious and Sustainable Post-pandemic Workplace Design for Teachers …

359

performance on international measures trails behind those in other countries, and
even portrayed as culpable for innumerable perceived social and moral ills (Ingersoll,
2004). Standardized testing is one accountability mechanism, and teachers perceive
these measures as having an array of negative impacts on their teaching as well as the
profession. Not only are the tests seen to be misaligned with best practices for assessment, but they also contradict quality education practices, go against ongoing educational reform efforts, and impact teachers’ pedagogical decisions in ways that limit
meaningful student engagement in learning and confine curriculum decisions with
the emphasis on “core” subject matter (e.g., Abrams et al., 2003; Aydeniz & Southerland, 2012; Sleeter, 2012). Further, many teachers believe the pressure to increase
test scores encourages them to “teach to the middle” rather than differentiate across
the full range of learners—increasing rigor for some and offering additional support
for others—effectively promoting the status quo rather than rewarding teachers who
strive to help all students achieve success (Aydeniz & Southerland, 2012). Since the
widespread implementation of standardized testing in the U.S., teacher perception of
their own autonomy has decreased (Warner-Griffin et al., 2018a, b). This is a troubling
finding, since lower levels of autonomy are associated with lower commitments to
teaching (Warner-Griffin et al., 2018a, b; Weiss, 1999) as well as higher rates of attrition (Guarino et al., 2006; Ingersoll & May, 2011). Heightened academic standards
have come along with the increased accountability measures. As proficiency standards increased, many have objected, citing these as developmentally inappropriate
(NAEYC, 2015). Teachers are left to operate in response to, rather than in collaboration with, the decisions of their district and school and administrators, who themselves are reacting to state and federal policy. Teachers perceive that emphasizing
student outcomes on standardized tests limits teacher autonomy, stifles creativity,
and restricts the curriculum to which students are exposed. Consequently, 25% of
public-school teachers who left the profession reported that accountability systems,
such as their school’s assessments and accountability measures, were extremely or
very important in their decision to leave (Podolsky et al., 2016).
The pervasive issues described above are just a few characteristics that contribute
to the decreasing recruitment and increasing attrition rates of teachers. Like so many
professions in the United States, working conditions have been transformed by the
COVID-19 pandemic, and the cracks in the structure of the teaching profession—
and the U.S. education system as a whole—have only been exacerbated. The purpose
of this chapter is to identify the impacts the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the
teaching workforce in Arizona.

14.1.3 Escalating and Intensifying Professional Demands
During the COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a dramatic impact on the professional lives of
educators. Recent national studies found that the overwhelming majority of teachers

360

R. L. Audrain et al.

are working more than they did before the pandemic (77%) and enjoying teaching
less (60%; Horace Mann, 2020). Teachers are concerned about workplace exposure
to COVID-19 (Expect More Arizona, 2020), more so than those in other professions
(Brenan, 2020). They feel insecure about their district’s health and safety precautions
(59%), believe annual leave benefits are insufficient to cover unplanned health-related
absences (66%), and do not trust that their health insurance benefits are sufficient to
adequately cover illness or other health issues (44%; Mann, 2020). Overall, many do
not support in-person instruction during the pandemic because of the risk of exposure,
with teachers of color even more reluctant to return to in-person instruction (Kurtz,
2020). Morale has declined dramatically; 85% of teachers report lower teacher morale
in their school now as compared to before the pandemic began (Will, 2021)—with
concerns for physical safety, emotional exhaustion, and pressure from added demands
of teaching during times of extreme uncertainty.
The national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers recommendations for mitigating the spread of COVID-19 as schools (re)open, including maskwearing, physical distancing or barriers, enhanced classroom sanitation routines,
ventilation system inspections and potential improvements, and operational routines
and regulations for students, teachers, staff, administrators, and visitors (CDC, 2021).
While some districts provide adequate personal protective equipment (i.e., masks
for teachers and students, gloves, sanitation supplies, physical barriers), a lack of
certainty about access to supplies left many teachers crowdsourcing from neighbors, friends, and families on social media. Beyond access to personal protective
equipment, widespread concern exists about physical school facilities, including
ventilation systems, space for physical distancing, and physical barriers. Given the
increased risk of transmission in poorly ventilated indoor spaces, ventilation inspections in all school buildings are recommended prior to re-opening. Compliance with
this recommendation has been inconsistent, with some regions inspecting all schools
and making updates or accommodations to ensure air flow, and others rejecting or
ignoring this recommendation entirely (e.g., Chicago Public Schools, n.d.; Irish,
2020). This inconsistent compliance with federal guidance around PPE and facilities that offer adequate ventilation invariably leaves teachers concerned that their
schools might become sites for widespread COVID-19 transmission. While some
CDC compliance measures are beyond the purview of teachers, measures for ensuring
physical distancing are largely determined and enforced at the school level, with
teachers creatively designing and constructing physical barriers, rearranging classrooms, and creating new routines to lower the risk of spreading and contracting
COVID-19. The ingenuity and determination evidenced in the creative solutions
teachers designed to safeguard children and themselves in classrooms is laudable,
with many teachers using out-of-pocket funds for supplies to construct these classroom modifications. Since we know that better school facilities are associated with
positive perceptions of working conditions (Buckley et al., 2005; Loeb et al., 2005),
concerns related to physical conditions of schools and classrooms in the midst of
a pandemic, where inadequate facilities and supplies put teachers and students at
heightened risk, inevitably has a detrimental impact on teacher perceptions of their
working conditions both during the pandemic and beyond.

14 Ambitious and Sustainable Post-pandemic Workplace Design for Teachers …

361

In addition to safeguarding themselves and children within physical classroom
environments, teachers are adjusting to new instructional modalities. Few districts in
the U.S. have continued exclusively with in-person instruction for all learners. Most
have adopted some combination of onsite, hybrid, or fully remote instruction, often
shifting among these several times within a single semester—often with little to no
notice—as community or school COVID metrics change. The uncertainty and ambiguity around instructional environments have been a source of stress for teachers. For
some, this stress is exacerbated by technology challenges that existed for teachers
and students alike, including access to devices that could be transported outside the
school, reliable internet, or technology tools for remote learning (e.g., webcams;
Weinberg et al., in preparation; Will, 2020). Whether teaching in person or remotely,
or some combination of the two, all teachers are adapting to new instructional environments. Beyond sanitizing classrooms and navigating the maze of online learning
systems, teachers are learning and adopting pedagogies for teaching online, implementing strategies to engage learners remotely, and working to build relationships
with and among students as well as families and caregivers in this new modality
(Hamilton et al., 2020).
Teachers are engaging in professional development either on their own or provided
by their district to learn new technologies, adopt pedagogies for teaching online, and
support students to become successful learners in new online and hybrid learning
environments (Weinberg et al., in preparation; Wright et al., 2021). Of particular
concern was the need for training to support students who were particularly vulnerable (e.g., those with disabilities or experiencing homelessness) as well as address
mental health and wellbeing concerns that may be triggered or exacerbated by the
pandemic (Hamilton et al., 2020). Effective pedagogical and learner engagement
strategies used in classrooms do not translate directly to remote learning environments. For example, for most in remote classrooms, whole-group interactions are
the norm and learners have limited opportunities to interact with—and learn from—
one another. Teachers find themselves struggling to formatively assess students and
provide meaningful and timely feedback, even though they find themselves spending
more time on grading and giving feedback outside of class time than ever before
(Weinberg et al., in preparation). In addition to learning new pedagogies, teachers
in online environments must also guide students toward appropriate self-regulation,
metacognition, and active learning strategies for this new environment (Broadbent
& Poon, 2015; Peterson et al., 2018). Collaboration with families and caregivers is
more important now than at any other time. Parents and caregivers play a heightened
role in supporting the success of online and hybrid learning for K-12 students, taking
on many roles previously assumed by instructional and support staff at school (Perry,
2020), and even some of the roles teachers play in a traditional classroom environment (e.g., establishing routines, managing stress, creating learning spaces). In fact,
learners’ attitudes and dispositions towards learning are more strongly influenced by
supports they receive from families and caregivers than teachers (Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development, 2020). Many learners, however, do not
have an adult or older sibling to provide such support (Expect More Arizona, 2021;
Weinberg et al., in preparation; Wright et al., 2021), leaving teachers to feel uncertain

362

R. L. Audrain et al.

and helpless, even as they are spending more time than ever working to engage and
effectively communicate with families and caregivers. Expectations for caregiver
involvement in the support of learning during the pandemic is a global phenomenon.
In Norway, for example, many parents shared that they spent a significant amount of
time following-up on their children’s schoolwork (Blikstad-Balas et al., 2021).
These additional demands on teachers are occurring simultaneously with professional isolation, leaving teachers to navigate this shifting professional terrain with
few, if any, opportunities to build on the collective expertise of other educators. This
lack of collaboration, coupled with policies that restrict or prohibit community volunteers from school sites and virtual classrooms (e.g., CDC, 2021; TESD, 2021), the
reduction of intervention services, and the reduction of paraprofessionals (Burnette,
2020) teachers are navigating this unprecedented terrain without the synergy that
comes from professional support and collaboration (Ritchie, 2012).
Beyond the physical concerns and the challenges of adapting to new and sometimes frequently changing instructional modalities, public sentiment toward educators has shifted dramatically. The reputation of the teaching profession has been
fraught for decades, with teaching often depicted as a low-demand occupation that
is well-suited for individuals seeking to comfortably balance work and family life
(Bartlett, 2004). The combination of low pay, low status, and job security that comes
with tenure contributes to the devaluation of teachers, reinforcing the erroneous idea
that those who teach do so because of a lack of other options (Bartlett, 2004). This
devaluation of teachers appeared to abate early in the pandemic. Initially, as students
were sent home to learn in Spring 2020, there was widespread support and appreciation for teachers and the roles they play in the lives of children and caregivers alike.
As summer progressed and the Fall 2020 semester began, some of these narratives
shifted. Presumably, some of this can be attributed to the increasing politicization
of COVID-19 in the U.S., the equivocal evidence around the risk of transmission
in schools (Viner et al., 2020, 2021) and public health benefit of school closures
(Silverman et al., 2020), as well as the broader academic, social, public health, and
economic impacts of school closures (Kneale et al., 2020; Viner, 2021). Some districts
were forced to cancel reopening plans when teachers refused to return to in-person
instruction early on. As districts across the U.S. continued with plans for in-person
instruction despite rises in coronavirus cases, teachers staged sick-outs and strikes in
protest (e.g., Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Texas). Teachers
and classrooms were maligned for their reluctance or refusal to return, even accused
of not caring about students or their education (e.g., Nocero, 2020). The embattled
and uncertain process of returning to school has exacerbated long standing concerns
that confront teachers individually and collectively.
Amid this shifting professional terrain for teachers, perceptions of reduced power
and professional agency are pervasive (Weinberg et al., in preparation). Narratives
of “learning loss” and “learning inequalities” dominate the news as teachers are
following district and school mandates that educators often believe are misaligned
with the developmental and academic needs of children, and potentially detrimental
to their growth and wellbeing. For example, to meet minimum contact time with

14 Ambitious and Sustainable Post-pandemic Workplace Design for Teachers …

363

students, many are required to replicate an in-person school day in an online environment by spending the entire school day on-screen. Further, grading systems (e.g.,
report cards) and large-scale assessments have often remained unchanged, even when
many districts have adopted flexible attendance policies (Dusseault & Makjori, 2021).
As students continue to be measured on learning gains and losses using pre-pandemic
measures and metrics, teachers are keenly aware that their own evaluations are contingent on student performance, as is school and district funding, and, in some cases,
the lives and futures of students (e.g., ACT, AP, graduation requirements). While
this push to continue the testing mandate at this time has been called “an attack
on public schools, teachers, and students” (Sanser, 2020, para. 9), to “ease up” or
deviate from mandated standards would be to disregard the potential implications
for teachers themselves, their schools, and students. As the narrative of learning loss
and continued standardized testing exert pressure to focus on academics, teachers’
concerns extend beyond the academic success of their remote and onsite learners, to
include mental health and wellbeing of their students (Weinberg et al., in preparation)
and other factors that contribute to inequities for students. Teachers are well aware of
the implications for students when parents and caregivers are working or otherwise
not able to provide support, for students without access to internet or devices, and a
litany of other variables impacting the lives of students during the pandemic (Expect
More Arizona, 2021; Weinberg et al., in preparation). Greater autonomy and input
in school decisions are factors associated with more positive working conditions
(Guarino, Santibañez, & Daley, 2006; Ingersoll, 2001; Ingersoll & May, 2011). This
widespread sentiment that professional agency has been even further reduced might
be considered one of the greatest threats to the professional wellbeing of teachers.
Each of these factors contributes to a looming concern: in our pre-pandemic
content, widespread teacher burnout has already led to a crisis-level shortage of
teachers. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this workforce crisis that is
likely to persist for many years to come. Safety concerns due to COVID-19 have
prompted teachers to consider leaving the profession (Flannery, 2020). While this is
troubling, what is even more concerning are the working conditions—expectations
that teachers respond to ever-increasing demands without equitable compensation.
If this continues, as scholar shea martin quipped “[we’re] going to lose an entire
generation of not only students but also teachers.” For states like Arizona, where
teacher shortages have been at crisis levels for years, this could be catastrophic for
students, teachers, public school systems and teacher education programs alike.
Organizational pressure has the potential to inspire innovation and productive
risk-taking (Richardson, 2002), but this potential is limited without environments
that promote agency and emphasize collegial support that promotes self-confidence
(Peltonen, 2015). Teachers need to be supported to work closely with one another,
to leverage strengths and resources of other educators (Kraft et al., 2015). In addition, they need sufficient access to the array of services and programs that could be
provided by other professionals within a comprehensive holistic educational system
(e.g., social workers, psychologists, school counselors, nurses). Positive relationships among teachers and robust support systems are associated with heightened
morale and improved working conditions (Borman & Dowling, 2008; Ladd, 2011;

364

R. L. Audrain et al.

Kraft et al., 2018) If these were in place prior to the pandemic, teachers would still
face challenges, but would not be saddled with the increased workload and stress
that comes from working in isolation and without adequate material or relational
resources.

14.1.4 Compounding Factors: Personal, Structural,
and Social Considerations
The professional unpredictability and isolation, learning of new pedagogies and
strategies to engage learners in new instructional environments, and concerns for
health and wellbeing are occurring simultaneously with personal life circumstances
and experiences that put educators at increased risk for burnout (Bassok et al., 2020).
Teachers are finding fewer outlets for their stress and anxiety, giving up self-care
routines, and suffering physical and mental health consequences (Aperribai et al.,
2020). Further, personal relationships have been altered dramatically, with some
living in physical (and often social) isolation, avoiding direct contact with others
including friends and family. Conversely, many find themselves in the opposite
scenario, with individuals (e.g., parents or caregivers and children) together most
or all of the time. While this is the common experience for most across the United
States, there are some factors that are unique to or more commonly experienced by
teachers.
Teaching is a profession primarily comprised of women. In the United States,
most teachers are women (76%), and women make up an even larger proportion of
teachers in elementary grades (89%; Taie & Goldring, 2020). Women, more often
than their male counterparts, take on uncompensated household and caregiving roles,
and this has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Women are two-thirds
more likely to serve as primary caregivers for family members (NAC, 2009), and
are more likely to have both formal and informal caregiving roles, (Langer et al.,
2015). Further, eighty percent of single-parent households are headed by women.
Caregivers are placed at an increased risk of exposure, increasing the chance that
they will need to take leave time if they become ill. Relatedly, close contact with
colleagues and students in schools introduces concerns for these primary caregivers,
as this contact increases the vulnerability of their own families and others, they may
care for to COVID-19.
One implication of the low salary for teachers is that many take on a second or third
job to make ends meet; estimates are that nearly 60% of teachers have jobs outside of
their teaching role (García & Weiss, 2019). While many found themselves stretched
thin while managing multiple jobs and personal lives prior to the pandemic, the
circumstances amid the pandemic make juggling multiple jobs even more daunting.
Some are finding this so challenging to manage that they are risking their financial
stability by quitting their additional jobs (Weinberg et al., in preparation). In addition,
as businesses and services have closed or reduced operations, other teachers have

14 Ambitious and Sustainable Post-pandemic Workplace Design for Teachers …

365

lost their additional incomes. As structural inequities have been laid bare during
the pandemic, many of these intensify inequities for teachers and students alike.
For example, for teachers and their students, an uneven technological infrastructure
means many lack high-speed broadband coverage (Pew, 2019), and fewer devices
in homes. These COVID-19 related increases in financial pressure and personal
responsibilities exacerbate the stress and anxiety caused by uncertain and expanding
professional responsibilities required of teachers during the pandemic.

14.1.5 Arizona Context
Arizona faces unique challenges in its teacher workforce. Arizona teachers are more
likely than those in 48 other states to express their willingness to leave the profession.
Nearly half (47%) of Arizona teachers surveyed recently said that they would leave
the profession “as soon as possible” if offered a higher paying job compared to
the 35% national average (NCES, 2017). Compensation, therefore, is a contended
working condition for Arizona teachers. While there are dramatic differences in
adjusted salaries from state to state (NCES, 2019), this alone does not account for
the discrepancy among teachers from various states when asked if they would leave
for a higher paying job. Underscoring this, in recent years there has been significant
first- and second-year teacher turnover. For example, in 2013–14, “24% of first year
teachers and 20% of second year teachers left their positions and were not reported
as teaching in Arizona” (Arizona Department of Education [ADE], 2015).
Additionally, AZ has more pathways to licensure than most states, and most of
these pathways have their own certification. For the purposes of this study, “typical” certifications refer to those individuals who complete a comprehensive teacher
education program that involves both extensive coursework as well as mentored field
experiences. These are generally university-based programs. In addition, “atypical”
certifications are held by teachers who entered the teaching profession through a
different route or pathway. Teachers may be, for example, licensed with an alternative/teaching intern certification, an emergency substitute certification, emergency
teaching certification, international teaching certification, or substitute certification.
An alternative/teaching intern certification is designed to enable individuals to enter
into a teaching contract while simultaneously completing the requirements for an
Arizona Standard Professional teaching certificate (Arizona Department of Education, 2018a, b). Ideally, the teaching intern certificates expire and, by the time it does,
the holder will be eligible to apply for a professional certificate. That is, the certificate
holder must be enrolled in an Arizona State Board approved alternative path to certification or teacher preparation program while they are under contract. At minimum,
the holder must have a fingerprint clearance card, a bachelor’s degree, a verification letter from their Arizona State Board approved program and have passed their
subject area’s subject knowledge exam requirement. An alternative/teaching intern
certification may only be used in the district requesting the individual to have this

366

R. L. Audrain et al.

certification and is valid for a finite period of time since teachers holding this certificate will apply for a professional certificate upon completion of their certification or
preparation program.
The traditional substitute certificate requires an individual to have at minimum,
a bachelor’s degree and fingerprint clearance card (ADE, 2017b). The substitute
certificate is valid for 6 years and is renewable. An emergency substitute certification,
on the other hand, is only valid for one school year and entitles the holder to only teach
in the district that verifies an emergency employment situation. Unlike the traditional
substitute certificate, the emergency substitute certificate only requires the holder to
have an associate’s degree and high school diploma. Holders of both the traditional
and the emergency substitute certifications are not eligible to be assigned a contracted
teaching position and are limited to 120 of substitute teaching per school year (ADE,
2017a).
Emergency teaching certificates are issued when there is an emergency employment situation, and a request is made by the district or charter superintendent. The
emergency teaching certificate holder may enter into a teaching contract, but only in
the district requesting the certificate. This certificate is issued for early childhood,
elementary, and secondary teaching certificates and their required endorsements. As
of August 2017, however, emergency teaching certificates ceased to be issued for
special education. The emergency teaching certificate can only be issued three times
to an individual, and those who were on an alternative/teaching intern certification
are ineligible for an emergency teaching certificate. (ADE, 2017c). Requirements
for this certificate are more stringent than other emergency certificates for both the
holder and district or charter school. The teacher must have a bachelor’s degree, have
passed the exam requirements, and have a fingerprint clearance card. In addition to
the superintendent verifying that an emergency employment situation exists, the
position must have been advertised on a statewide basis and with, at minimum, three
career placement offices at higher education institutions. Additionally, the district or
charter school must be participating in an Arizona State Board approved alternative
path to certification program, or if the superintendent can evidence that the program
is not available or not capable of alleviating the emergency situation.
The international teaching certificate “is issued to teachers from foreign countries
who are contracted through the foreign teacher program as authorized by federal
statutes enacted by the Congress of the United States or other foreign teacher recruitment programs approved by the United States Department of State or the United
States Citizenship and Immigration Services and who are working under a J-1 or
Q-1 visa” (ADE, 2018b). The holder’s certificate is valid for the length of their J-1 or
Q-1 visa and may be extended, though it is limited to 12 years. The holder must have
a fingerprint clearance card and a verification form from an ADE-approved Foreign
Credential Evaluation Agency that the holder has, at minimum, a bachelor’s degree
and completed a teacher preparation program, both comparable to those in the United
States. Lastly, holders need a letter signed by an Arizona school personnel director
or superintendent that the individual is in a contracted teaching position through a
foreign teacher program.

14.1.6 Arizona COVID-19 Policy Timeline and Guidance
Unlike other countries and most other states in the U.S, Arizona is a local control
state, meaning that public school governance and management is given to the elected
representatives on the school board, who make pertinent decisions about operations
as opposed to the state and federal government (“Local Control,” 2016). Local control
is similar to Finland’s “decentralized” schooling system, which can be seen as both a
challenge and an asset. While decentralization has made state-wide, uniform decision
making about COVID-19 response difficult, it has also allowed flexibility in local
decision making, ceding autonomy to local areas’ and cities’ contexts (Lavonen,
2021). While Arizona and Finland may share similar decentralized systems of education, in Arizona, decentralization and local autonomy has meant that some districts
are more equipped than others to take on the challenges they face.
Further, Arizona’s K-12 school systems are fractured across schools and districts,
as districts may be K-8, 9–12, or K-12. As a result, when 8th grade students leave
their K-8 district, they matriculate to many different 9–12 districts. In addition to
this fractured articulation, Arizona currently has some of the most extensive school
choice options, where students and families may elect to attend schools outside those
assigned by the location of their family residence. This includes other public schools
within and outside their home district as well as online or charter schools. In 2020,
public charter schools made up 28% of the state’s total schools in 2020, with 20%
of Arizona public school students attending a charter school (ACSA, 2020). Local
control has left decision making regarding COVID-19 up to each district, and some
major decisions have even been left to the school level (e.g., learning management
systems). Due to Arizona’s unique school governance structure, this chapter cannot
fully represent the alternative means of education, reprioritization of curriculum, or
attendance found in all schools. We can, however, discuss the overarching policy
responses from state agencies, such as the Governor’s office, Arizona Department
of Health Services (ADHS), and ADE and provide anecdotal responses from district
leaders about their decisions.
On March 13th, 2020, Doug Ducey, Governor of Arizona, made a statement after
the presidential declaration of a national emergency related to the nascent COVID19 pandemic. March 15th marked the day that the Governor and the Superintendent
of Public Instruction, Kathy Hoffman, announced an initial two-week closure of
Arizona schools. During this initial closure, the primary focus swiftly shifted to
a focus on physical wellbeing and safety of students rather than instruction. The
main concern, addressed in a March 16th update, focused on long-term scenarios
for school closures and solutions to looming uncertainty, such as access to food. On
March 20th, the Governor and Superintendent declared another two-week extension
of school closures. Arizona State Representative Michelle Udall crafted House Bill
2910 releasing public schools from the requirement to make up the missed instructional hours due to statewide closures, canceling the statewide assessment, and reaffirming that all school employees—including hourly employees—would continue to
be paid during the closures (Office of the Governor of Doug Ducey, 2020). The state

368

R. L. Audrain et al.

house and senate unanimously supported the bill, and Governor Ducey signed the
legislation on March 27th. The initial responses to the pandemic were addressed as
temporary. On March 30th, however, Governor Ducey and Superintendent Hoffman
announced school closures through the end of the school year.
Uncertainty about school modalities of instruction loomed throughout the
summer. In an Executive Order signed by Governor Ducey on June 29th, the physical
reopening of schools was delayed until August 17, 2020, but schools could choose to
conduct distance learning before then. On July 24th, the Governor and Superintendent released the “Arizona: Open for Learning” plan, investing a total of $440 million
federal dollars into public schools while also commissioning local school leaders to
make decisions about their COVID-19 response plans. By August 6th, a $7.5 million
partnership between the Governor’s office, the Arizona Department of Education,
Helios Education Foundation, and Arizona State University was launched to help K12 teachers deliver quality instruction in online and blended learning environments.
That same day, the Arizona Department of Health Services and Arizona Department of Education released benchmarks to help guide local decision making for
public school districts and charter schools about when to offer fully virtual, hybrid,
or in-person instruction amidst the ongoing pandemic.
The beginning of the school year would be met with many public-school districts
engaging in patchwork policy making and implementation. This was exacerbated
by the aforementioned fragmented nature of Arizona school district structure. For
example, some schools who began their school year online had cohorts of freshmen
from multiple schools and districts. This fragmentation was only compounded by
the increasing politicization of the pandemic and the precautionary measures, such
as mask-wearing. On November 19th, 2020, Dr. Cara Christ, the Director of ADHS,
issued an emergency order mandating that all students, faculty, staff, contractors, and
visitors in public district and charter schools must wear a mask on school campuses,
buses, and during school-related activities., Governor Ducey also announced the
additional distribution of $370 million in Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic
Security (CARES) Act funds to schools. The investment of federal dollars is similar
to Spain, where national funding supported local education communities’ direction,
implementation, and enhancements necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic (Valle
& de Olagüe-Smithson, 2021). The funds were released at the beginning of the 2020–
21 Spanish school year, September 2020. A marked difference for Arizona and other
states in the U.S. is the timing of the receipt of the funds, which were not received
until months into the 2020–21 school year.
Tensions between the Governor’s Office and the Superintendent of Public Instruction became evident at the beginning of 2021. State Superintendent Hoffman called
for Governor Ducey to order all schools to conduct distance learning for two weeks
after the winter break for schools so families could quarantine to stop the spread of
COVID-19. C.J. Karamargin, a spokesperson for Governor Ducey’s office, said that
the governor would not consider the request, reiterating that mode of learning would
be left up to individual school districts. Just a few days after this exchange, Governor
Ducey delivered his annual State of the State Address on January 11th, 2021, in
which he said “we will not be funding empty seats or allowing schools to remain in

14 Ambitious and Sustainable Post-pandemic Workplace Design for Teachers …

369

a perpetual state of closure. Children still need to learn, even in a pandemic.” While
unclear about the fiscal implications, educators and education advocates interpreted
the governor’s comment that districts must “return to full-time in-person school or
lose funding” as a threat.

14.2 Findings
Local Education Agencies (LEAs) are asked to report site-level data at the beginning
of each school year to the Arizona Department of Education’s (ADE) Teacher Input
Application (TIA), annually, including information on teachers, teaching positions,
administrative positions, and certification status (ADE, n.d.). In addition, teacher and
principal evaluation performance data is reported through this application. It is only
recommended that LEA’s input their information, but Title I schools and charter
schools must enter their information. They are required to keep the data updated
throughout the school year by editing the application as changes occur. Unfilled
positions are not updated in the Teacher Input Application.
For this study, we examined year-over-year (YOY) comparisons from 2017 to
January 2021. While a majority of the data were from comparisons between January
2020 and January 2021, 2017–2019 end of year snapshots were included to see if
any YOY changes were actually part of an existing trend. Overall, the number of
teachers reported to ADE’s Teacher Input Application has remained steady during
the school year (SY) 2019–20 to SY 2020–21 period—around 58,000 teachers were
reported in January 2020 and around 59,000 teachers were reported in January 2021.
The total number of LEAs and schools reporting have increased, so small variations
can possibly be attributed to the slight differences in year-to-year reporting. Overall,
reporting quality at the LEA and site-level has been typically high, around 96%.
The average Arizona teacher has around 11 years of experience and is 43 years old.
The number of novice teachers—those with no experience—currently working as of
January 2021 has remained steady from January 2020. A majority (76%) of teachers
are female, and the largest ethnic groups of teachers in Arizona are white (75%) and
Hispanic (16%). Both gender and ethnic groups have remained steady, though the
American Indian/Native Alaskan teacher population saw a 6% decrease. Arizona has
seen a decrease in educators teaching Native American Language/Culture (14%),
Bilingual/Structured English Immersion (13%), and Reading Intervention (3%).
Given the recent increased acknowledgement of the systemic erasure of Native
American and other cultures, the decline (albeit slight) in American Indian/Native
Alaskan teachers and those certified to teach Native American Language and Culture
is notable. This is of particular relevance as teachers personalize learning for students,
employing culturally sustaining and/or culturally relevant pedagogies. It is essential
to have teachers knowledgeable about diverse cultures and backgrounds, and to
leverage the expertise of teachers around them. Similarly, although a relatively small
decrease (3%), reading intervention is going to be a critical need next school year,
as the inequitable experiences among students will become more evident the longer

370

R. L. Audrain et al.

some students are learning remotely or in conditions that are heavily impacted by
the pandemic.
The teacher populations have remained steady in terms of their location characteristics, or what country they are in, and whether they are in urban—including
suburban—or rural schools. While there has been a slight population shift at the
county level between SY 2019–20 and SY 2020–21, the population has remained
steady. The shifts have been minimal for schools that are labeled urban or rural.
There have been significant increases in charter schoolteachers from 8,600 in SY
2019–20 to 9,800 in SY 2020–21, a 14% increase. In addition, there were significant
increases in online teachers from 800 in SY 2019–20 to 1900 in SY 2020–21, a
136% increase. Face-to-face public school teacher populations have remained steady,
including the teacher populations at Title 1 eligible/ineligible schools. Schools were
receiving funding for prior year counts, so changes may be seen in the future. It is
worth noting that in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of these teachers
in face-to-face schools are now remote.
Our study found that there was a 52% (approximately 900–1,400) increase in
emergency teaching certificates from SY 2019–20 to SY 2020–21. While on first
glance this seems on par with predictions about COVID-19’s impact on the teacher
shortage, this number actually reflects the pandemic’s impact on licensure. ADE
granted around 600 educator preparation program completers, who were not able
to register for their licensure exams, emergency teaching certificates in lieu of their
full, typical certification. We separated the EPP completers on emergency teaching
certificates from true emergency teaching certificates (~800) which is a decrease
from this point in time last year.
Individuals with emergency teaching certificates are more concentrated in Yuma
County (15%) versus the overall teaching population (3%), in Title I schools (83%
vs. 62% overall), and in elementary grades (76% vs. 65% overall) during SY 2019–
20 to SY 2020–21. They average two years of teaching experience versus the overall
average of 11, and the age range is skewed toward the younger population with
over 50% of the holders being between 18 and 29 and the average age being 33.
More Hispanic and Black teachers have emergency teaching certificates than typical
certificates (29% vs. 16% overall for Hispanic teachers; 7% vs. 4% overall for Black
teachers). Less white teachers, however, have emergency teaching certificates than
typical certificates (56% vs. 76% overall).
For individuals not certified—or those in teaching positions without any valid
certificates—there was an 17% increase (approximately 3,200–3,700) from SY
2019–20 to SY 2020–21. These individuals are more concentrated in Maricopa
County, the state’s most populous county where 66% of the Arizona teacher population works. Seventy-six percent of the non-certified teachers in Arizona work in Maricopa County, more concentrated in its urban areas, charter schools, and in schools
that are Title I ineligible schools. Further, teachers on emergency certificates are
much more inexperienced. Like the emergency teaching certificates, the age range is
skewed toward the younger population. More Black and Asian teachers are teaching
without certification. Notably, the proportion of male teachers teaching while not
certified is also higher (31% vs. 24% overall).

14 Ambitious and Sustainable Post-pandemic Workplace Design for Teachers …

The Arizona School Personnel Administrators Association (ASPAA) is an organization that targets and represents human resource professionals and school personnel
in Arizona. Early in the SY 2020–21, the ASPAA administered a survey and over
200 public school districts and charter schools responded (ASPAA, 2021). Per their
survey, as of December 2020, there were about 7,485 teacher openings that needed to
be filled for SY 2020–21. Of those, 1,988 were teacher vacancies, meaning the positions were filled by having teachers work on 6/5ths contract, meaning that they have
no planning time (40%), long-term substitutes (30%), contracted agencies (18%),
administration or certified specialists (e.g., instructional coaches) (3%), collapsing
where existing teacher(s) have a class size that exceeds the school’s class size limits
(3%), vacancies, classified personnel (e.g., paraprofessionals) (3%), and collapsing
in which the school created multi-grade classrooms (2%). Additionally, of the 7,485
teacher openings, around 3,482 were filled by individuals not meeting standard
teacher requirements. These positions were filled by individuals who received an
emergency teacher or substitute certificate (32%), those who were pending certification (23%), those who received a teacher intern certificate (18%), subject matter
experts (13%) or those whose certificate is based solely on their degree content area
and not the completion of a teacher preparation program, those hired from outside
of the United States (11%), or those who were a pre-service (not graduated) student
teacher who assumed full responsibility as “teacher of record” of a classroom (6%).
Finally, the remaining 1,360 teacher openings were comprised of educators
severing employment as of December 2020. Of these teachers, 79% resigned and,
regardless of reason, their school or district approved their “release of contract”;
12% of these teachers did not report to work at the start of the school year; and
10% abandoned their position. Of the teachers who severed employment, 37% cited
COVID-19 as their primary reason.
The data show, however, that the trend of overall teacher openings in Arizona has
remained steady over the past three years. As of December 2019, there were around
7,570 teacher openings, and as of December 2018, there were around 7,453 teacher
openings (ASPAA, 2021). These teacher opening trends demonstrate instability in
Arizona’s teacher labor market. The teacher labor market’s instability is a problem of
the conditions embedded in the education workforce’s design. Rather, the full professionalization of the teaching profession can only be accomplished through transformations of the characteristics that define the profession itself, including teachers’
organizational and working conditions (Ingersoll & Collins, 2018).

14.3 Conclusion
In Arizona, we have, so far, been lucky; the numbers related to issues brought up
in this article have not significantly changed as a result of the pandemic. Arizona
already faces a significant challenge in staffing its schools with qualified individuals.
Many predicted COVID-19 would force more people out of the profession than usual.
Some believed that this would be seen in increased retirements and resignations at the

372

R. L. Audrain et al.

end of the 2020 school year. And others predicted teachers would leave classrooms
after the tumultuous school 2020–21 year commenced. Time will tell. Recent surveys
(e.g., Brenan, 2020) and anecdotal evidence suggest that an astounding number of
teachers are considering leaving the profession. When teachers and students return to
the classroom for the next normal, much will be unrecognizable. Learners will have
changed significantly—mentally, physically, and emotionally—as will have teachers.
Many students will have lost a year or more of learning and teachers will need to
meet them where they are. In a one-teacher, one-classroom model, where teachers
are expected to know and be able to do everything, it was difficult pre- pandemic and
after—impossible. The numbers weren’t great to begin with—a dire circumstance
of thousands of teachers leaving, more alternative certification and novice teachers
coming in trying to learn a complex profession in isolation. If the pandemic has
taught us anything, it is that isolation has outsized negative consequences.
While some might believe the obvious answer is to find more people to teach, we
disagree wholeheartedly. Although recruitment to the teaching profession has faced
sharp decreases in recent years, it is woefully insufficient to focus exclusively, or
even predominantly, on recruitment efforts. Experts in content can teach, but this is
not enough—thousands leave every year, and this research spotlights that issue of
retention. Instead, we should be making large-scale systemic transformations to the
characteristics that define the profession itself, including teachers’ organizational
and working conditions to increase both agency and collaboration. This includes
restructuring the traditional hierarchy of the U.S. public school system to include
roles for individuals with different levels of skill, focusing on factors that have been
identified as relevant to improving the working conditions for teachers (e.g., material resources, class sizes, physical structures, and occupational health and safety
concerns; Emerick et al., 2005).
Profound changes to the status quo are essential to address the challenges teachers
face and ensure the teacher workforce does not continue to decline. Plans for a more
holistic and comprehensive view on teachers and their needs, as well as those of
students, are imperative as schools prepare for full reopening. This should include
wellbeing supports for teachers (Green & Bettini, 2020) as well as explicit attention
to rebuilding school communities to support healthier working conditions to reduce
isolation and expand their support networks. Prior to the pandemic, teachers felt
insufficiently prepared to identify and respond to the mental health needs of students
(Reinke et al., 2011). The pandemic not only magnified teachers’ and students’ needs,
but it also showed that successfully leveraging the expertise of all educators will be
critical. Hence, there is a need to reconsider how educators work together to meet the
holistic needs of students. New kinds of learning environments will need to be created,
teachers will need to learn to work in teams, distributing expertise. The novice or
even the teacher candidate who comes into a classroom will need the support of a
team in real time, not before or after school. Teachers will need to examine data and
consider how they group their students to personalize learning. We will need community members who are trained in the instructional skills and brought in to help and
support professional teachers and novices. Paraprofessionals and instructional aides
will need additional specialized training in order to strategically support classroom

14 Ambitious and Sustainable Post-pandemic Workplace Design for Teachers …

373

learning. We need to lean into technology that can help personalize and provide
foundational skill building. Professional teachers will need time for planning for
deepening learning, applied knowledge, and personalization. Additionally, schools
and districts may consider creating new positions in their schools that allow some
teachers to assume “hybrid” roles. This could include part-time classroom teaching
and part-time leading, mentoring, or action research (Berry et al., 2011).
These ambitious shifts are achievable. Collaboration will be key, and new roles
such as team leaders will be crucial. Having thousands of unfilled positions in
December of each year is a huge red flag that the education workforce is not stable
and is unsustainable the way it is. In addition to more robustly funding PK-12 education to enable compensation increases for teachers, systems and structures in schools
much change. This is the lull before the storm if we do not start doing something to
prepare teachers now for new organizational structures and for new ways of implementing what we know is quality teaching and learning. We need to stop thinking
about teacher shortage as a retention and recruitment problem and start thinking
about transforming the teaching profession itself.

Education in the Time of COVID-19
in France, Ireland, the United Kingdom
and the United States: the Nature
and Impact of Remote Learning
William Thorn and Stéphan Vincent-Lancrin
Abstract This chapter reviews the evidence of the impact on children’s education
from the school closures, implemented over the period March-June 2020, as part
of the lockdown measures put in place to control the spread of the Covid-19 virus.
The sources of information are surveys of the adult population, parents/guardians of
school-age children, teachers and students based on representative samples as well as
achievement tests that were accessible by early 2021. The lockdowns and associated
closures of schools implemented in response to the arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic
represented a sudden and unprecedented event for which school authorities, teachers,
parents, and students were unprepared. While distance and remote education arrangements were put in place at short notice, they represented an imperfect substitute to
in-person schooling. In the short-term, the consequences of school closures and lockdowns appear to have been modest in scale and impact in the reviewed countries.
For most (though by no means for all) children, missing 8–18 weeks of face-to-face
schooling appears not to have had dramatic consequences for either their academic or
broader development, or led to the significant widening of pre-existing inequalities.
However, a definitive assessment of the impact of the school closures in the first half
of 2020 will not be possible for some time.

15.1 Introduction
The objective of this chapter is to offer some insight into the impact on children’s education from the school closures, implemented over the period MarchJune 2020, as part of the lockdown measures put in place to control the spread of
the Covid-19 virus. The sources of information are surveys of the adult population,
parents/guardians of school-age children, teachers, and students, as well as achievement tests that were accessible by early 2021. The information was collected during
the period of lockdown or close thereafter. The focus is on evidence from surveys and
studies based on representative probability samples—that is, from surveys collecting
information from samples designed to be representative of clearly defined target
populations. The exception is the discussion of the results of academic achievement
tests. The corpus of studies meeting this condition is surprisingly small, even in highincome countries. Consequently, most of the information comes from five countries:
France, Ireland, England, and the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States
(US) (see Annex A for details). Depending on the topics, the picture is supplemented by information from Australia, Belgium (Flanders), Italy, and the Netherlands. The picture that is drawn is inevitably partial, not only geographically, but also
thematically as the studies from which information has been drawn were developed
or adapted very quickly to collect information on a range of topics related to the
experience and behaviour of individuals and households during lockdown.
The combination of the closure of schools and the broader lockdown/confinement
measures affected the life of children and their families, transforming children’s educational experience during the duration of confinement. The setting in
which education took place moved from school buildings to the family home
for most children. The mode of instruction shifted from face-to-face contact with
teachers/instructors to some form of remote learning, often supervised by parents.
The home and social environment of children was also affected in many ways that, in
its turn, may have affected the educational experience of children. In-person contact
with people other than household members was severely restricted. The working
arrangements of many parents changed, often dramatically. Many were laid-off on a
temporary or permanent basis and many others had to work from home. In addition,
parents faced a range of stresses associated with the pandemic: about the health of
family and friends, the education of their children, their work, and finances.
While related and interacting with one another, two different aspects of the health
crisis should be separated: (1) school closures and education continuity from home
(or under new arrangements) for children, and (2) the general social and family environment in which this took place. While the latter is also relevant to the experience of
learning under lockdown, the focus of this chapter is the first aspect. Two broad issues
regarding school closures are explored: the nature of the educational experience of
primary and secondary education students during the period of school closures, and
the effect of school closures on students learning.
The presentation covers four main topics: aspects of schooling during lockdowns;
learning time during school closures; parental and family involvement in children’s

15 Education in the Time of COVID-19 in France, Ireland, the United Kingdom …

385

learning; and the positive and negative aspects of home learning. The focus on these
topics reflects the fact of which data is available. At the same time, they represent
topics of considerable interest for policy makers and analysts wishing to understand
the experience of school education during lockdown and its consequences (which is
itself one of the reasons that data was collected on them). Whenever possible, the
equity dimension (the differences in the experience of pupils from different social
backgrounds) is explored.
The approach adopted is deliberately descriptive. This is an inevitable consequence of the small number of countries from which data is available, as well as
the partial nature of the data available. While a detailed comparative analysis of
the experience and outcomes of Covid-related school closures in different countries
would be fascinating, the data does not permit it at this time. The point is rather
to present the available information from good quality studies on topics relevant
to understanding the experience of learning during school closures with the aim of
empirically grounding examination and discussion of these issues in actual examples.

15.2 Aspects of Schooling During Lockdowns
15.2.1 School Building Closures Meant that Most, but not All
Students, Changed the Location and Form of Their
Schooling
In most, though not all, countries across the world, the measures implemented to
control the spread of the Covid-19 virus during the “first wave” of the pandemic
from late February to June 2020 involved generalised “lockdowns”—restrictions on
movement and the size of gatherings (public and private), the closure of a range of
businesses and other institutions, including schools and other educational institutions
such as vocational colleges and universities. The duration of school closures over the
period February to the end of June 2020 (the end of the school year in the northern
hemisphere) was between 0 and 19 weeks (including vacations) in OECD countries,
depending on the level of schooling. Accounting for vacations in this period (around
2–3 weeks in most countries), closures meant the substitution of 4–9 weeks of face-toface instruction with home-based learning in most OECD countries (OECD, 2021).
In those countries in which schools were reopened for face-to-face instruction before
the end of the 2019–20 school year, the reopening of schools was often staggered.
Different year groups returned at different dates and pupils did not necessarily return
on a full-time basis. In addition, some parents continued to keep their children at
home even if they belonged to the age or year groups eligible to return to school. In
some countries, schools continued to be closed from the end of July in the southern
hemisphere or did not reopen at the start of the 2020–21 school year.
The closure of schools did not mean that all children undertook their schooling
at home. In some countries (including those covered in this chapter), the children of

386

W. Thorn and S. Vincent-Lancrin

so-called “key” or “essential” workers, of parents who had difficulty looking after
children at home during usual school hours, and children in vulnerable circumstances
could continue to attend school in-person. The available information suggests considerable variations between countries regarding the proportion of children that attended
school in-person during lockdowns. In England, the numbers of children attending
school on any day during lockdown were low. From 20 March 2020 until 1 June 2020
when schools started to reopen, between 1 to 3% of enrolled pupils attended school inperson on any day (Gov.uk, 2020), with around 7% of parents in one study reporting
that their child aged 5–16 years had attended school in-person during lockdown (NHS
Digital, 2020, Table 4.1). In Australia,1 17% of parents/guardians reported that the
child in their household attended school in-person (ABS, 2020, Table 3.1). In France,
31% of primary schools, 25% of lower secondary schools, and 6% of upper secondary
schools remained open for attendance by children of essential workers (Barhoumi
et al., 2020, Fig. 7.1), but the number of students involved are not available.
In many countries, there was also a small group of children whose mode of learning
was not directly affected by school closures—around 3% of school enrolments in
the United States, where the phenomenon is the most widespread (Snyder, de Brey
& Dillow, 2019, Table 206.10),2 and less than 1% in other countries—e.g., Australia
(Chapman, 2020), France (Assemblée Nationale, 2019), and England (Office of the
Schools Adjudicator, 2020).

15.2.2 Instruction and Instructional Materials Were Mainly
Online or Paper-Based, Although Classes Were
Sometimes Cancelled
One of the features of schooling during school closures was the use of online resources
and tools to deliver lessons and instructional materials, and to communicate with
students. What was the balance between the use of online resources and tools to
deliver lessons, access, transmit, and receive instructional materials and student work
compared to other, more ‘traditional,’ means?
The use of online tools and platforms was the predominant mode of delivery of
lessons and learning materials for students undertaking their education at home (see
Annex B, Table 15.10), primarily through dedicated educational platforms, applications, or e-mail. Real time interaction with teachers represented a relatively small
component of the educational experience of schoolchildren during school closures.
In the United Kingdom, 25% of parents reported that their child had received realtime interactive learning in the previous seven days, while in England, 32% of parents
reported that their child had received one or more online live lesson per day. Fourteen

less severe ‘lockdown’ measures regarding restrictions on business activities were
implemented than many other countries.
2 In the US Household Pulse, around 5% of parents/guardians in the US reported that their child
was ‘already homeschooled’ in waves 1–6 (US Census Bureau, 2020, Education Table 1).

15 Education in the Time of COVID-19 in France, Ireland, the United Kingdom …

387

percent of German teachers stated that they had taught classes by video calls. In the
US, the average total time spent by all students in households in contact with teachers
was 4 h per week (see Table 15.4 below).
Paper materials provided by schools were also used by a reasonably sized minority
of students, in most cases in conjunction with digital materials. In France, 11%
of students received learning materials in the form of printed documents. In the
US, 19–21% of parents/guardians reported that their child’s classes had moved to
a distance format using paper materials. Higher rates of usage of paper materials
were reported in the United Kingdom, where 34% of children who were homeschooled used some non-digital resources provided by their school. From the supply
side, teachers in Germany reported that 33% of learning resources were shared in
the form of hardcopies via post or pickup, and 54% of US teachers reported using
hardcopy materials as part of distance learning.
The extent of the use of online tools and resources for the delivery of instruction
and materials increased with the age of pupils and level of education. The proportion
of teachers in France suggesting activities to students that required use of a computer
connected to the internet was lowest at primary level and highest at upper-secondary
level (see Annex B, Table 15.10). In the United Kingdom, the proportion of children
using of school-provided real-time interactive online learning increased with the age
of the oldest child and the use of school-provided non-digital resources declined
(ONS, 2020, Table 2). Similarly, the share of students having one or more online live
lesson per day in the United Kingdom was higher for secondary students (36%) than
for primary students (27%) (Benzeval et al., 2020).
The United States is the only country in which there is information on the use
of different modes of remote instruction by parental characteristics. The proportion of households in which some or all of children’s classes moved to a distance
learning format using online resources increased with the educational attainment
of the respondent and household income; it was also associated with ethnic background. Classes were more likely to have moved to online delivery among households
in which the respondent was white or Asian (78% and 82% respectively), than Black
(65%) or Latino/Hispanic (72%) (US Census Bureau, 2020, Education Table 2).
The positive relationship between education and income and being a member of a
Black or Hispanic/Latino household, and the probability of some or all of children’s
classes moving to online delivery may have reflected a deliberate choice on the part
of their schools to use paper-based materials due to the difficulty (real or perceived)
for their students to access materials online. The data suggests, however, that rather
than compensate for difficulties with online access by using paper-based materials,
schools may have chosen simply to cancel some classes. There were only small
differences in the proportion of households in which some or all of children’s classes
moved to a distance learning format using paper materials sent home according to
the characteristics of the respondent. At the same time, children in low-educated and

388

W. Thorn and S. Vincent-Lancrin

low-income households and children in Black and Hispanic/Latino households were
more likely than children in more advantaged households to have some or all their
classes cancelled.3

15.2.3 Access to Digital Devices and Networks Was Limited
for a Sizeable Minority of the Population
Given the reliance on online delivery of instruction, learning materials, and online
communication between students and teachers, access to the necessary devices and
networks was essential for students to continue their schooling successfully. What
evidence is there regarding access to digital devices and the Internet during the
period of school closures and the extent to which access was related to student’s
socioeconomic background?
A substantial minority of households and students (Table 15.1) experienced
difficulties with access.
Unsurprisingly, access to digital devices and a reliable internet connection was
related to social background. In the United Kingdom, lack of devices was more often
cited by parents as a reason for their children struggling to continue their education in
low-income households than high-income ones. However, no clear relationship with
level of parental education was observed (ONS, 2020, Table 4). In the United States,
the proportion of parents reporting that it was very or somewhat likely that their child
would encounter at least one of three digital obstacles to doing their schoolwork at
home (“needing to use a cell phone,” “using a public Wi-Fi network because no
reliable internet at home,” and “being unable to complete schoolwork because they
did not have access to a computer at home”) decreased with family income (Horowitz,
2020). The share of households with children in public or private schools with a
computer always available for educational purposes also increased with household
income (US Census Bureau, 2020, Education Table 3). Teachers in the United States
working in high poverty schools were significantly more likely to report that their
students lacked access to the internet and devices at home (Stelitano et al., 2020). The
school or school district played an important role in the provision of computers for
use by students in the US. Around 40% of parents/guardians reported that the child
in their household had access to a computer provided by the children’s school or
school district for use outside school (US Census Bureau, 2020, Education Table 4).
The use of a computer supplied by the school or school district was highest among
households headed by low-educated and low-income adults and in households headed
by Blacks, Hispanics, and Latinos. The importance of the school in the provision of
devices in the US is confirmed by a survey in late April/early May 2020, in which

3 For example, the proportion of Black households (48%) in which children had some or all their

classes cancelled (and not moved to other fomats) was 10 percentage points higher than that of
White households (38%).

78% of teachers indicated that their school provided students with devices (Stelitano
et al., 2020). In contrast, in the United Kingdom, only 5% of parents who “homeschooled” their eldest/only child indicated that their child used a device provided by
the school and 73% stated that they provided a device for their child (ONS, 2020,
Table 2). Unfortunately, data on the source of the devices used by children to access
instructional material and communicate with their school are not available for the
other countries covered, which may reflect the fact that the provision of computers
by schools was uncommon.4

4 OECD (2021, Fig. 2.2) reports that over 80% of the countries providing data indicated that they

offered support to “populations at risk of exclusion from distance education platforms” in the form
of “subsidised devices for access (PCs or/and tablets)” during the first period of school closures.
However, no information is available on what proportion of pupils had access to such support.

15.2.4 Teachers May Have Lowered Their Ambitions
Regarding the Content of Instruction
The closure of school buildings meant that the delivery of education had to be adjusted
to allow (most) students to continue their education in their homes. There is evidence
from France and the United States that the content and focus of instruction and the
amount of work pupils were expected to do was also adjusted to reflect the new
circumstances of learning.
French teachers reported that the main priority of their school during the period
of closure was to preserve their pupils’ link with learning (53% of primary school
and 58% of secondary school teachers), rather than to continue to advance with
the teaching programme (cited by 5% of primary and 7% of secondary teachers)
or the consolidation of students’ learning (cited by 23% of primary and 12% of
secondary teachers) (Barhoumi et al., 2020, Figs. 6.1 and 6.4). The results of the
survey of US teachers in late April/early May 2020 suggest that they adjusted their
expectations in similar ways. Only 12% of teachers reported covering all, or nearly
all, of the curriculum that they would have covered had their building remained open.
In response to the question of whether they were focusing on reviewing content that
was taught before Covid-19 versus presenting new content, 46% indicated that they
were focussing mostly or exclusively on review rather than introducing new content
(Hamilton, Kaufman and Diliberti, 2020).

15.3 Learning Time During School Closures
An important indicator of the effect of school closures and the associated changes
to the mode of instruction on pupils’ learning is the amount of time that school
students devoted to educational activities during this period. This can be compared
with normal instruction time at school to give an idea of the impact on the quantity of
learning. While informative, some caution is advised in making such comparisons.
On the one hand, the estimates of learning time at home are likely to be subject to
reasonably large measurement errors as they are usually provided by parents, who
may have an inexact understanding of how much time their children (especially older
children) spent on schoolwork. On the other, official instruction time is not an errorfree measure of the time pupils devote to learning either. Children attending classes
are engaged in learning to varying degrees (from staring out the window to giving
full attention to the lesson). In addition, in normal times, many students undertake
schoolwork at home in the form of self-study, homework, and preparation for exams
and tests.

15 Education in the Time of COVID-19 in France, Ireland, the United Kingdom …

391

15.3.1 Around 10 to 20% of Students May Have Stopped
Their School Learning Activities
There is evidence that a small, though by no means negligible, proportion of students
stopped (school-related) learning activities during the period of school closures. One
measure of this is the proportion of students with whom schools had no contact. In
the Czech Republic, schools lost contact with over 20% of upper-secondary students
enrolled in the vocational track, and between 15 to 20% of students enrolled in
primary and lower-secondary education (CSI, 2020). Smaller proportions of children
were ‘lost’ to the system in France, where teachers estimated that they had lost contact
with 6% of primary school students and 10% of secondary students in their classes
while schools were closed (Barhoumi et al., 2020, Figs. 1.9 and 1.10). In line with
these estimates, 8% of parents of French high school students indicated that their
child had not done any schoolwork set by their teachers during the period of school
closures (Barhoumi et al., 2020, Fig. 2.8). In the United Kingdom, 17% of 16–18year-olds in full-time education surveyed between 7 May and 7 June 2020 indicated
that they had not continued with their education in the previous week5 (ONS, 2020,
Table 5).
In addition, there were children who did not receive any schoolwork from their
schools. In the United Kingdom, for example, around 10% of parents of schoolchildren reported that their child had not received schoolwork to complete at home in
April 2020 (Eivers, Worth & Ghosh, 2020). The proportion was highest for children in upper-secondary schooling. Around 25% of the parents of children in Key
Stages 4 and 5 (years 10–12) indicated that their child received no schoolwork. For
children preparing for exams (e.g., GSCE and A-levels), this may have reflected the
fact that they had already covered the relevant curricula by the time schools had
closed and there was no need to undertake further study during a period normally
devoted to exam revision. In other data from the United Kingdom, 25% of parents
reported that children who were educated at home had not undertaken activities using
materials provided by their school in the preceding week (ONS 2020, Table 2). It is
not possible to determine whether this was because no schoolwork was provided or
because children and/or their parents decided not to use it.

15.3.2 Students Spent About Half Their Normal “in-Person”
Time on School-Related Learning Activities
The amount of time students spent on schoolwork during the period of school closures
is a topic covered in several surveys. The data collected is not completely comparable,
however, in terms of the definitions of schoolwork, the reference period (an average
day, the previous week), or the exact populations covered. For this reason, Tables 15.2,

schoolwork by students during lockdown was 2 and 2.4 h depending on the data
source. At the secondary level, the estimates were between 3.0 and 3.2 h (Table 15.3).
In the United States (Table 15.4), an average of 23 h per calendar week was spent
on learning/teaching activities per household. A direct comparison of this figure with
the estimates in England, France, and Ireland is impossible for two main reasons:
(1) it represents the sum of the hours spent by all children in the household on learning
activities and all hours spent by all household members on teaching activities with
children rather than hours per individual child, and (2) learning/teaching activities
are not limited to those based on materials or lessons provided by schools.
In France, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States, the school week
generally involves around 4.5–6 h of instruction time per day (23–30 h per week)
depending on the country (and in the United States and the United Kingdom, states
or regions within countries and even individual schools) and the level of schooling
(see for France, Ministère de l’Éducation Nationale, 2021; for Ireland: Gov.ie, 2019;
and for the US: NCES, n.d., Table 15.14). Thus, in the four countries for which we
have data, the average amount of time (per day or per week) that school pupils spent
on schoolwork (however defined) during the period of school closures was less than
the hours of instruction time that they would have received at school in ‘normal’
conditions. In England, France, and Ireland (unfortunately the US data does not lend
itself to such a calculation), this represents about half the usual instruction time (about
3 h compared to the 5–6 h of formal instruction per day, depending on the level of
schooling). In addition, as noted above, in ‘normal’ conditions, many students would
also spend some time undertaking additional schoolwork or study activities at home.
As can be seen from Tables 15.2 and 15.3, there was considerable variation in
the time spent on schoolwork by individual children. In normal conditions, the time
spent by pupils being instructed in classes will not vary greatly, as this is set by
the school timetable and the relevant regulations. Variation in the time devoted to
schoolwork will be due largely to time spent on schoolwork at home by students
(e.g., in the form of study, revision, homework, completion of assignments, etc.). In
the period of school closures, time spent on schoolwork was to a greater or lesser
extent determined by the students themselves and their parents as opposed to the
‘institutional constraints’ of timetabled classes.

15.3.3 Time on Schoolwork Shows no Strong Relationships
with Parental Education or Household Income
The time children spent on schoolwork during school closures shows no clear
relationship with either the level of education of parents/guardians (Table 15.5),
household income, or ethnicity.
Of the four countries for which data is available regarding the level of education
of parents/guardians, the United States is the one country in which hours of schoolwork (in this case, total hours of live contact with teachers and hours spent on their
own learning by children in the household) shows a positive relationship with the
education level of parents/guardians.
Data on hours of schoolwork during school closures is available by the respondent’s income (UK) and household income (US), and by ethnic background (US).
Hours of schooling are highest for students with a parent in the highest income group
in the United Kingdom (ONS, 2020, Table 2), but no association exists between
household income or ethnicity and hours of schoolwork in the United States (US
Census Bureau, 2020, Education Table 1).

15.4 Parental and Family Involvement
Given the limited direct contact students had with teachers, parents and guardians had
to take over much of the role of the supervision of their children’s education (including
instruction) during the period of school closures. In this section, we explore the role
parents, guardians, and other family members played in the education of children.

What proportion of parents assisted their children and how much time did they
spend doing so? What assistance did they provide and how comfortable were they
with supporting their children’s education?

15.4.1 Younger Children Received More Assistance
from Parents
Data on whether parents/guardians assisted their children with their schooling during
lockdown is available for France, the United Kingdom, and the United States
(Table 15.6). The French data refers to the proportion of students reporting that
they were assisted by their parents, and the UK data to the proportion of parents
reporting that they “home-schooled” their eldest/only child. High proportions of
parents/guardians aided with their children enrolled in primary and lower secondary
education. In both countries, the proportion of parents assisting their children
declined with the age of the child and the child’s level of education. This is likely
to reflect the greater autonomy and independence of older children and the lesser
expertise of parents concerning the content of the curriculum in the later years of
high school.
In France and the United Kingdom, in addition to having a greater probability
of receiving assistance from their parents/guardians, younger children (in lower
grades) also received more assistance than older children (in higher grades). The

time devoted by parents to assisting their children per day decreased as the level
of their children’s schooling increased (Table 15.7). A large proportion of parents
in both countries reported that they provided very little support to children enrolled
in academically oriented upper-secondary education. In France, 40% of parents of
students in lower-secondary education and 70% of parents of students in uppersecondary general education assisted their children for less than 30 min per day.
In the United Kingdom, 60% and 90% of parents for lower- and upper-secondary
students respectively assisted their children for less than an hour per day. The average
time devoted by parents in the United Kingdom to assisting children is estimated to be
2 h per day (of assistance) to primary school children and 0.9 h per day for secondary
students (Pensiero et al., 2020). In the United States, the total average time devoted
to teaching activities during school closures by parents/guardians was around 12 h
per week – per household rather than per parent (see Table 15.4).
As expected, the amount of time parents devoted to assisting children with schoolwork was higher for most (but not all) parents during the period of school closures
than was usually the case. Overall, 65% of the parents of French high school students
said that they spent more time than usual during confinement helping their children
with schoolwork, 21% as much time as usual, and 8% less time (Barhoumi et al.,
2020, Fig. 5.5). In Italy, two thirds (67%) of adults who cared for children of 0–
14 years of age during lockdown reported spending more time in childcare activities
(both homework and play) compared to an average pre-Covid day, 30% the same
amount, and 3% less time (Istat, 2020, Fig. 4).
There is little evidence of a close relationship between parental socio-economic
status and the provision of assistance by parents in the available studies. In the
United Kingdom, no relationship is observed between the level of parental education or income and the “provision of home schooling” (ONS, 2020, Table 2) or the
hours of assistance provided by parents (Benzeval et al., 2020). A similar picture is
seen in the United States, where no clear relationship exists between either parental
education or income and the total hours spent by household members on teaching
children (US Census Bureau, 2020, Education Table 1), or between income and the
provision of additional instruction and resources (Horowitz, 2020). This is somewhat contrary to expectations. However, it is possible that parents with higher levels

15 Education in the Time of COVID-19 in France, Ireland, the United Kingdom …

397

of education and income had less available time to assist their children during
the period of lockdown than their less-educated and lower-paid counterparts. The
incidence of temporary inactivity (e.g., furlough, temporary layoff) during lockdowns was lowest for employees in management and professional occupations—i.e.,
occupations associated with high levels of education and high incomes.

15.4.2 Around Half or Less of Parents Felt Capable to Assist
with Their children’s Remote Education
The shift of the setting of school education to the home placed a large responsibility
on parents/guardians for supervising and guiding their children’s education. How
comfortable with and prepared for the role were parents/guardians?
In both the United Kingdom and the United States, slightly less than half of
the parents/guardians of school children appeared comfortable in their ability to
support the home schooling of their children. At the end of April 2020, only 45%
of parents/guardians in the United Kingdom agreed that they were confident in their
abilities to support schoolwork of their children within their household, even if a much
larger share (75%) believed that they had access to the resources they needed to help
them “home school” their children/child well (ONS, 2020, Table 1). In a national
survey of parents of K-12 students in the United States, 56% of parents reported that
their child’s remote learning had been difficult or very difficult for themselves and
their spouse/partner (Jones, 2020b). Consistent with this, in May 2020, two-thirds
(68%) of US parents reported that knowing how to teach children in ways they could
learn had been a challenge in terms of the remote distance education of their child
(Jones, 2020a).
Very similar results were found in France. Around half or more of French parents
of secondary students had some problems finding the time to assist children (51%)
and helping their children understand lessons (48%), with slightly lower proportions having at least some problems helping their child understand instructions
from teachers (42%) or finding information about the schoolwork that needed to
be completed (40%) (Barhoumi et al., 2020, Fig. 5.4).
In Ireland, parents seemed even less confident (CSO, 2020). When asked in
August 2020 whether they were concerned about their capacity to provide adequate
home learning support if their child’s primary school was closed in the new school
year, 85% of Irish parents of primary school students indicated that they had some
concerns, with 51% being very or extremely concerned.
The available evidence regarding the relationship of socio-economic status and
parents’ perceptions of their ability to provide support for their children’s education is
ambiguous, if not contradictory. In the United Kingdom, parents with higher degree
qualifications were more likely than other parents to agree that they were confident in
their abilities to “home school” the children/child within their household. However,
confidence in the ability to support children in their remote schooling was unrelated to

398

W. Thorn and S. Vincent-Lancrin

income (ONS, 2020, Table 1). In contrast, in Ireland, parents with higher education
qualifications were more likely to be ‘very’ or ‘extremely’ concerned about their
ability to provide adequate home learning support if schools were closed in the new
school year than parents with a highest qualification at secondary level or lower, and
less likely to be “not at all” concerned (CSO, 2020). The reasons for the differences
in the views of highly educated parents in the UK and Ireland must remain the object
of speculation.

15.5 Home Learning: The Positives and Negatives
Did the arrangements put in place to support home learning during school closures
allow children to maintain their link with schools and teachers and to continue to
learn effectively? Two main types of information relevant to this question exist. First,
there is the perception of actors involved. Several surveys sought the views of parents
concerning the support provided to their children during the period of closures and
remote learning and the difficulties experienced by their children. Second, there are a
small number of studies that have compared results on standardised tests for students
in the cohorts affected by the pandemic with results for students in the same tests in
previous years.

15.5.1 Parents Had Mixed Views: They Were Appreciative
of Schools’ Efforts, but Very Concerned About Their
children’s Learning
How satisfied were parents with the home-schooling experience and the support
offered by schools, and how did they assess the impact of the period of home schooling
on children’s learning and social development? Overall, parents/guardians had mixed
views. On the one hand, for the most part, they considered that their children had
continued with their education and appreciated the efforts made by schools and
teachers during the period of school closures. On the other, they were concerned
about effects of school closures on their children’s education and, in some cases, on
their broader social development.
Over three-quarters of the parents of French secondary school students believed
that the activities offered by teachers during the period of school closures had been
beneficial to their children (81% of the parents of lower-secondary school students
and 75% of the parents of students). They also saw positive effects in terms of
increased autonomy of their children (60%) and in the discovery of new methods
of learning (60%) (Barhoumi et al., 2020, Figs. 4.5 and 4.6). The amount of work
that schools gave to their children was seen as appropriate by nearly two out of three
parents of secondary school students, with between 16 and 23% of parents seeing

15 Education in the Time of COVID-19 in France, Ireland, the United Kingdom …

399

it as being too much and between 12 and 20% as too little (depending on the level)
(Barhoumi et al., 2020, Fig. 2.12) At the same time, most were of the view that while
their children’s learning had been maintained (66%), it had not progressed (58%)
and reported no perceived improvement in their children’s level in certain subjects
(63%) (Barhoumi et al., 2020, Fig. 5.7).
In the US, around four in five parents (83%) reported being satisfied with the
way their children’s school had been handling instruction during school closure
(Horowitz, 2020), and high proportions of parents rated their child(ren)’s school as
doing an excellent or good job in terms of teachers availability to answer questions
(77%), communication about the distance education programme from the superintendent and/or principal (71%), provision of materials and equipment needed for the
child to do schoolwork (75%), and communication about specific assignments from
teachers (72%) (Jones, 2020a). Satisfaction with schools was nevertheless accompanied by concern about the impact of home schooling on their children’s educational
progress. In late March 2020, 42% of parents of K-12 students were “very” or “moderately” concerned that the pandemic would have a negative impact on their child’s
education (Brenan, 2020) and, in a poll conducted in early April 2020, 64% of respondents were concerned about their children falling behind because of the Corona virus
outbreak (Horowitz, 2020).
Some 70% of parents in the United Kingdom agreed that children within their
household were continuing to learn whilst being schooled from home. At the same
time, 43% of the same parents agreed that remote schooling was negatively affecting
the well-being of their children, and 42% of parents agreed that their oldest (or only)
children were struggling to continue their education remotely (ONS, 2020, Table 4).
In Ireland, in August 2020, only one-third (36%) of parents of secondary school
students were worried about their child returning to school because they had fallen
behind due to lockdown (CSO 2020, Table 3.6). However, most parents/guardians
had a negative impression of the impact of enforced school closures (CSO 2020,
Tables 2.1, 2.2, 2.4 and 2.5). Closures were seen as having a major or moderate negative impact on students’ learning by 41% of parents of primary and 46% of parents
of secondary students and on their social development (42% and 23% respectively).
Few parents/guardians of either primary or secondary students (close to 15% in both
cases) viewed the impact of school closures as neutral or positive on either their children’s learning or social development. Irish parents were also rather negative about
their child’s school in providing adequate home learning support should schools be
closed again, the implication being that they were not particularly happy about the
support provided during the closures earlier in the year. Some 38% of parents of
primary school students were very or extremely concerned, with only 23% not being
concerned at all. Concerns were greatest regarding children in secondary school.
The share of parents who were very or extremely concerned about schools’ capacity
to support home learning rose to 52% in the case of children enrolled in the junior
secondary certificate, and 72% for those enrolled in the leaving certificate.

15.5.2 The Performance of Students on Standardised Tests
Compared with that of Their Peers in Previous years
The concerns of parents that their children’s learning had not progressed during the
period of school closures to the extent that it would have in normal circumstances
are echoed by many other commentators. Claims regarding potentially dramatic
“lifelong” learning losses and the widening of inequality and long-run economic
costs have been made based on simulation studies (see, for example, Azevedo et al.,
2020 and Hanushek & Woessman, 2020). Comparisons of the results in standardised
tests administered in 2020 following the return of students to school with those in
similar tests for students in the same year level in earlier years provide an important
source of empirical information regarding the academic progress of pupils during
this period. Testing programmes were interrupted due to the pandemic in many
countries. However, testing continued in a few others and several comparisons of
the performance of students experiencing school closures in 2020 with students in
the same year of schooling in 2019 and earlier years have been released. Table 15.8
presents the results of five studies (using data from England, France, Flanders, the
Netherlands, and the US).
The most comprehensive and highest quality data concerning the academic
progress of the cohort of students affected by school closures comes from France.
Results from annual national tests conducted at the start of the school year for students
in Years 1, 2, and 6 and in the middle of the year for students in Year 1 have been
released for the 2020/21 school year. The tests had very high rates of participation
by schools and students in all years covered (including 2020 and 2021). In the other
studies, the data come from non-representative samples of schools (England, the
Netherlands, the United States) or suffers from low participation by schools in the
2020 testing round (Flanders). In addition, in the countries in which the tests were
conducted at the end of the 2020 school year (Flanders, the Netherlands, and the
United States), rates of participation by students were low.6
Results vary widely. Improvement, as well as stability and decline (both small
and large) in the performance of the ‘Covid cohorts’ relative to their peers tested in
previous years is observed (Table 15.8). In France, the performance of the cohort of
Year 6 students tested at the start of the 2020–21 school year improved relative to their
peers tested in 2019 in both French and mathematics, with the improvement being
more pronounced in French than in mathematics. The performance of the 2020–21
Year 1 cohort tested in mid-year also improved compared to the 2019–20 cohort in
both domains. Interestingly, its performance had fallen relative to students tested in
the previous year cohort in the tests conducted at the start of the year, suggesting that,
during the first six months of the 2020–21 school year, these pupils had caught up on
any instruction that they had missed in March-June 2020. Stability or small declines
in performance were found in France (Year 2 in French and mathematics), Flanders
(social science) and the United States (reading). Large declines were observed in
6 The effects of selection biases and non-response on the representativeness of the results are argued

to be negligible by the authors of all the studies concerned.

England (maths and reading), Flanders (Dutch, French, maths, and science), the
Netherlands (a composite measure), and the United States (maths).
Evidence regarding the differential impact of the disruptions to education caused
by school closures by socio-economic background is also mixed. The French and
US studies find little evidence of widening socio-economic gaps in performance
between 2020 and previous years. In fact, in France, performance in French improved
marginally more for students in Year 6 who attended schools belonging to “priority education networks” that catered for pupils from lower socio-economic backgrounds conditions than for other students. However, in mathematics, students in
these “priority education” schools improved to a lesser extent than that of their peers
in other schools (Andreu et al., 2020a, p. 37). The studies using Dutch (Engzell,
Frey & Verhagen, 2020) and Flemish data (Maldonado and De Witte, 2020) find
that the performance decline of the Covid cohorts relative to pre-Covid cohorts is
greater among students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The English study
comes to similar conclusions by inference rather than observation (Rose et al., 2021,
pp. 10–12), and the evidence is unconvincing.7
The difference in the results found in these studies is intriguing and its explanation
is beyond the scope of this paper. Apart from issues of sampling and missing data
mentioned above, the timing of testing may have some impact. The French assessments were undertaken at the beginning of the 2020–21 school year (September 2020)
in conditions far closer to the ‘normal’ conditions that applied in previous testing
rounds than was the case for tests conducted in June 2020. In addition, the extent to
which the tests evaluate knowledge directly related to the content of the curriculum
may differ. For example, the French assessments are primarily diagnostic in focus
rather than intended to evaluate what had been learnt in the previous year.
The scale of the effects estimated in the English, Dutch, and Flemish studies
deserves some comment. The Flemish study concludes that, on average, the average
gain in performance of Year 6 students in 2020 was only half to one-quarter of that
expected in a normal year. This effect seems implausibly large. The implication is
that the substitution of remote schooling for school-based instruction for a period
of seven weeks8 (around 20% of yearly instruction time) resulted in a reduction of
50–75% of the normal yearly learning gain. At face value, the Dutch and English
results seem more credible, as they suggest that pupils learnt about 80% of what they
would be expected to learn in a normal year. However, even here, the inference is
that students at best maintained the level of improvement they had achieved when
their schools closed—which is surprising given that most students continued some
form of school learning from home during the school closures. At the same time,
the results that suggest no impact of the disruption to schooling on performance
also raise questions. They stand in contrast with the evidence that while most pupils

nondisadvantaged pupils” (Rose et al., 2021, p. 10). The authors, instead, compare the standardised
achievement gap observed among the 2020 sample with that derived from another assessment
carried out in 2019 to estimate whether the gap has grown.

continued with their education, they spent less time, on average, in learning activities
than they would have done had the 2019–20 school year continued as normal.
In the end, however, time will be needed before we have a good understanding
of the short- and long-term consequences of the period of school closures during
the first wave of the pandemic on the achievement and broader development of
students. Placing the results for 2020 in the context of longer-term trends is essential
for their interpretation, and the next waves of testing programmes will provide vital
information. For the moment, considerable caution should be exercised in attributing
a causal relationship between the disruption to children’s education due to lockdowns
and school closures, and changes to performance for students of the same age at the
same stage in their education tested in 2020 and in previous years (not to mention
longer time intervals). Many factors can lead to variations in performance between
different cohorts at the same point in their schooling: different past experiences,
variation in the distribution of demographic and other characteristics in different
cohorts, measurement errors (including variation in tests and their administration),
and in the case of sample studies, sampling errors. Adjustments can be made to
account for some of these factors in analysis, but not for others.

15.6 Summary and Conclusion
The aim of this chapter is to provide the reader with examples of the experience of
education during the first months of the Covid-19 pandemic in high-income countries, drawing on data derived from representative samples. The data which meets
this condition is restricted to a small number of countries—France, Ireland, the
United Kingdom, and the United States—supplemented by information, where available from Australia, the Czech Republic, Flanders, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. There is also variation in the coverage and treatment of different topics in the
different surveys, and often the information collected on similar topics in different
surveys is not entirely comparable. This data provides an important, if incomplete,
insight into the educational experience of schoolchildren and their families during
the school closures and lockdowns of March-June 2020.

15.6.1 The Overall Picture
The closure of schools appears to have led to some students disengaging from their
school learning. There is evidence that 10% to 20% of students may have discontinued
their school learning in some countries during the “remote learning” period.
In almost all the countries for which information is available, students spent on
average about 3 h per (school) day doing schoolwork at home—about half the face-toface instruction time they would have received at school. Students received assistance
from their parents (and from their other family members), but this assistance was

406

W. Thorn and S. Vincent-Lancrin

fairly limited in duration and scope and decreased as students got older. The most
common form of remote schooling in the OECD countries, for which representative
information is available, was for teachers to send online resources/exercises to their
students—most of the time through online platforms, sometimes also by e-mail,
and more rarely as paper worksheets. Teachers also provided virtual instruction and
assistance, but to a relatively limited extent.
The time spent on learning during school closures was related to the age of children. Younger children generally spent less time on schoolwork than older children.
In part, this reflects the fact that instruction time in normal school settings is less
for primary school than secondary students. In addition, schools and teachers may
have wished to avoid overburdening young children (and their parents) with schoolwork and focused on facilitating a continuing link with school and the maintenance
of study habits, rather than covering all aspects of the normal curriculum. Younger
children also received more assistance from their parents, probably because they
needed more, being less able than their older counterparts to work autonomously.
Parents offer a rather mixed evaluation of the impact of lockdowns and school
closures on children’s development and educational progress. High levels of appreciation of the work of schools and teachers during school closures was accompanied
by concerns regarding the effects of lockdowns and school closures on children’s
educational and social development. While most children maintained a link with
school and there were some positive features of home schooling for children, such as
increasing autonomy in learning and the discovery of new methods of learning, many
parents were concerned about lack of progress in some subjects and the possibility
that their children were falling behind.
The empirical evidence regarding the extent to which school students ‘fell behind’
or failed to make the same gains in achievement as they would have in normal
circumstances (“reduced learning gain” is probably a more accurate description than
the often used “learning loss”) is restricted to results from a small number of studies
of varying quality and generalisability. Both small improvements and large declines
in performance between students tested in 2020 and those tested in previous years
have been reported. The most robust available study, from France, suggests that it is
possible that the differences in achievement between the students affected by closures
in 2020 and students at the same level tested in 2019 was negligible (with both small
positive and small negative changes being found). At the other end of the scale,
large declines in achievement (in some cases implausibly so) were also found in the
studies using data from England, Flanders, the Netherlands, and the United States
(in mathematics but not reading). However, these studies were based on convenience
samples and/or had low rates of participation by schools and students in 2020. At
this point, any judgement on this question must remain provisional. More studies
using high quality data representative of the student population are needed.

15.6.2 The Equity Picture
A major concern in all countries is the possible differential consequences of school
closures, lockdowns, and the pandemic more generally on schoolchildren from
different social backgrounds. Given the well-documented inequalities in housing
conditions, access to technology and connectivity, in the educational services they get
from their schools, as well as on the impact of Covid on parents’ health and employment, concerns about students from lower socio-economic background being left
behind are more than reasonable. Those concerns are largely confirmed by the current
evidence, but some aspects of those inequities challenge some common expectations.
There is also good reason to believe that students who disengaged from their school
learning came disproportionately from lower socio-economic backgrounds, but there
is no direct information at this stage. Some factors for which we have information
point to that direction. The availability of devices and access to internet connectivity
affected more students from lower socio-economic backgrounds than others. There
is clear evidence of this in the United States, where poor access to computers and
connectivity disproportionately affected households headed by parents who were
less educated, earned less income, or were Black or Latino. In addition, in the US,
the pandemic disproportionately affected Black and Latino families, who were about
twice as likely as White and Asian people to be hospitalised and/or die from Covid,
which was likely to have an impact on the remote schooling of their (grand)children
(US CDCP, 2021).9
In the countries covered, there is no evidence (yet) of family socio-economic
status having an impact on the amount of time spent on schoolwork or the amount
of time parents spent assisting children: children from all backgrounds seem to have
devoted the same time to their schoolwork and have received the same amount of
parental assistance. In fact, students from higher socio-economic status families
sometimes received less support than those from lower status families. This may
reflect the fact that parents in higher-status jobs had less time to support their children
as they were more likely to have been working (rather than being on temporary layoff
or unemployed) during lockdowns than adults with less education in lower-status
occupations. It may be possible that the effectiveness of the assistance offered was
dependent of the level of education of parents. Importantly, however, the interest in
and willingness to provide support was equally distributed across households from
all backgrounds.

9 According to the (governmental) US Center for Disease Control and Preventions, as of February 18,

2021, compared to White non-Hispanic persons, Black or African American and Hispanics or
Latinos were 2.9 and 3.2-fold more likely to be hospitalised, respectively, and 1.9 and 2.3 more
likely to die from Covid-19, respectively. Black or African American and Hispanics or Latinos
were 1.1 and 1.3-fold more likely to get the virus. (American Indian or Alaska Natives are those
who were the most likely to get the virus, get hospitalised, and die.) Risk for Covid-19 Infection,

15.6.3 In Summary
The picture offered of the experiences and consequences in high-income countries
of the period of school closures in this chapter is a relatively optimistic one. The
lockdowns and associated closures of schools implemented in response to the arrival
of the Covid-19 pandemic represented a sudden and unprecedented event for which
school authorities, teachers, parents, and students were unprepared. Nevertheless,
distance and remote education arrangements were put in place at short notice in
emergency conditions. This allowed education to continue at home for most children,
and a form of school-based education to be offered to children with special needs and
the children of parents with no other care options, such as the children of ‘essential’
workers. While few would disagree that the distance/remote education arrangements
put in place represented a less than perfect substitute for normal classes, they ensured
that most, though not all, children continued to have a connection with teachers and
their schools. For the most part, teachers, students, and parents adapted to the new
arrangements. Most teachers continued to teach, and most students continued to
learn. The fears of significant negative effects on student learning appear to not have
been realised. While widening educational inequalities remains very plausible, they
seem to have been limited in the high-income countries covered. Such a dramatic and
sudden disruption to schooling arrangements can hardly be expected to have been
without some impact on students’ learning, especially in the context of the arrival
of a pandemic and the disruptive effect of lockdowns on every aspect of social and
economic life. However, even if definitive conclusions cannot be drawn at this point,
it appears likely that the negative consequences have been modest in scale and impact.
For most children, missing 8–18 weeks of face-to-face schooling, even in a situation
of lockdown, appears unlikely to have had dramatic consequences for either their
academic or broader development, or led to the significant widening of pre-existing
inequalities.
A few words of caution are necessary, however. The results presented in this
chapter relate to a small number of high-income countries that experienced about
2–3 months of school closure during the first wave of the pandemic. The situation
was and continues to be very different in middle- and low-income countries, where
schools, in some cases, remained closed for long periods and the establishment of
effective alternative delivery arrangements has been a considerable challenge. In
those countries, socio-economic disparities are more marked and more likely to
widen as time out of school increases.

15.6.4 Looking Ahead
Assuming some effects on student’s learning, an important question is whether
students affected will be able to ‘catch up’ on or consolidate any gaps in their learning
resulting from the disruption to their schooling during the period of school closures.
The scale of any on-going impact of the disruption to students’ education caused
by school closures on their academic performance and progress will be related to,
among other things, (1) the relevance of what has been missed for their subsequent
educational progress, (2) the opportunities they have and support they are given
to catch-up on any learning ‘gaps’ resulting from reduced instruction and learning
during school closures, and (3) the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Regarding the former, for many students failing to cover some elements of the
curriculum in some subjects may not matter for their subsequent progress (or, a
fortiori, for their “human capital” when they enter the labour market). By no means all
the content covered in a subject in one year is a necessary pre-requisite for subsequent
progress in either the subject area directly concerned or related areas.
In terms of the opportunities for catch-up, consolidation of the gaps in students’
education due to the disruption flowing from school closures was high on the agendas
of most governments and school authorities at the start of the 2020–21 school year.
OECD (2021, Table 3.3) reports that around three-quarters of the countries for which
data is available implemented ‘remedial measures to reduce learning gaps’ when
schools reopened after the first period of closures.10 In France for example, the
priorities for the new school year included support for students to consolidate the
aspects of their programmes that they did not cover due to confinement.11 In the UK,
the government introduced a Coronavirus catch-up premium and a national tutoring
programme to support students and young people affected by the disruption of their
education.12 Even in the absence of specific programmes, it is likely that teachers
will adjust their instruction to compensate for what was missed by students. Many
parents will make efforts to ensure that their children catch up, as may the students
themselves (especially those in senior high school). This is likely to be true regardless
of their socio-economic status (although their effectiveness in reaching their goals
may vary).

W. Thorn and S. Vincent-Lancrin

The evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic represents something of a wild card. At
the start of 2021, the school closures of March-June/July 2020 can be seen as the
first phase of a period of on-going disruption to school education that appears set to
continue until the middle of 2021. Schools reopened in most high-income countries
towards the end of the 2019–20 school year, at the start of the 2020–21 year in the
northern hemisphere or mid-year in the southern hemisphere. An exception is the
Americas, where schools have remained either closed in some countries or opened
unevenly due to the decentralised nature of the education governance. However,
even where schools reopened, children’s education continued to be affected by the
implementation of strict sanitary protocols, the closure of classes and individual
schools due to cases of Covid-19 among students and staff, and the introduction of
‘hybrid’ forms of schooling alternating face-to-face and on-line delivery of lessons,
as well as further episodes of school closures at regional or national level in some
countries. This continuing disruption has the potential not only to complicate the
consolidation of previous learning gaps, but also lead to additional learning gaps.
Given the relatively low level of continuing disruption in most countries, and the fact
that school systems will have learnt from the experience of the spring 2020 school
closures (see e.g., NSW Department of Education, 2020), it can be hoped that the
consolidation of learning will not be overly affected. However, the possibility that
the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic has more surprises in store cannot be ruled
out.
This leads to the issue of data and the long-term monitoring of the consequences
of the pandemic (not only the period of school closures in spring 2020) on children’s
schooling. Surprisingly, few high-quality data collections were put in place during
the period of school closures. This has restricted the capacity of researchers and
others to have a good understanding of what occurred during this period, and of the
behaviour and views of those involved and affected by closures and the disruption to
school education. In this respect, it is important that school systems and Ministries
of Education make publicly available as much of the administrative and other data
regarding this period as they can, as well as facilitate access to relevant documentation
about policies and administrative decisions. Access to data from standardised tests is
particularly important, not only from those that took place in 2020 and earlier years
but, equally importantly, those that will take place over the coming years.

The Unequal Impacts of COVID-19
on Student Learning
João Pedro Azevedo, Marcela Gutierrez, Rafael de Hoyos,
and Jaime Saavedra

Abstract COVID-19 is not only leading to lower student learning levels, but likely
resulting in a learning inequality catastrophe. In this chapter, we document the
high-levels of learning inequality (within and between countries) that existed before
the pandemic and disentangle the different mechanisms through which changes in
inequality in learning may happen because of a shock like COVID-19, examining
the role of school and family inputs. We show that historically, similar shocks in
average learning levels disproportionally affect the most vulnerable students, and
that emerging evidence from developed countries, as well as simulations, support
the expected significant shifts in the learning distribution. Finally, we present a set of
compensatory education policies that countries must urgently implement to reduce
the impact of COVID-19 on learning inequality and promote equality of opportunities
during and after the pandemic.

16.1 Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has generated the worst education crisis of the last century.
The health pandemic, its subsequent massive and extended school closures, and the
accompanying strain in public and family budgets (that result from one of deepest
global economic recessions in history) are unprecedented triple shocks to the human
capital of a generation of children. If recovery strategies are not successfully designed
and deployed, the intergenerational consequences of this pandemic will be felt for
several generations to come.
By early 2021, almost a year after school closures started, World Bank simulations show that learning poverty—the percentage of children who cannot read
and understand a simple text by age 10—could increase from 53 to 63% in lowand middle-income countries.1 It is expected that about 24 million children and
youth might not return to school or to a tertiary institution. In addition, there are
mental health, nutritional and socialization losses stemming from the lack of interaction among school-aged children and long-term damaging effects over those young
children who are still in early childhood.
But the impact of the crisis has been tremendously unequal both between and
within countries. First, the timing of the school closures and the priority given to
schools reopening at moments when the rates of infection of the pandemic receded,
have been vastly different across countries. Second, the capacity of countries to
respond with remote education options and its ability to maintain students engaged
in the learning process has varied substantially. At the country level, most governments tried to cope with the shock by implementing multimodal remote learning
strategies, relying in combinations of internet, TV, radio, and print. But the patterns
of take-up of these strategies vary substantially, and its effectiveness remain to a large
extend unknown. Poorer countries more frequently relied on radio and TV, while
richer countries relied on online education and take-home packages of educational
material. Third, household endowments that are important for the learning process
and can complement school inputs during school closures are unevenly distributed.
Some students have been able to engage with their teachers online, have connectivity, a space to study, books, and supportive parents at home. Others can at most
access a few hours a week of radio or TV programming, or nothing at all. All this
has generated extremely varied experiences along socioeconomic lines between and
within countries.
The potential increase in inequality between countries and within them stemming from COVID-19 might not be surprising if we look at what has happened
with inequality in learning in the recent past. Using PISA (Program in International
Student Assessments) data, we report that when learning improves, it is usually a tide
that raises all boats. However, when learning falls, reductions are not the same across
the board but proportionally worse among those at the bottom. In other words, looking

at past experience when average learning falls (as will be the case with the COVID19 slide), we can expect that low performing students will suffer disproportionally
more.
In this chapter, we document and disentangle the different mechanisms through
which changes in inequality in learning may happen because of a shock like COVID19. In doing so, we answer the following questions: (i) what was the status of learning
inequality before the pandemic, and how has learning inequality historically behaved
in the face of similar shocks?; (ii) What are the causal linkages between COVID19 and student learning outcomes?; (iii) What is the role played by pre-pandemic
inequities in determining the impact of COVID-19 on learning inequality?; (iv) How
are the remote education strategies implemented by governments around the world
mediating the effects of COVID-19 on learning inequality?; and (v) What can governments do to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on learning inequality and promote
equality of opportunities during and after the pandemic?
Section 16.2 shows pre-COVID-19 levels of learning inequality both between and
within countries and describes how trends in average learning are associated with
changes in learning dispersion. Section 16.3 develops a simple conceptual framework
to both understand the current levels of learning inequality and how it might change
because of the current pandemic. Section 16.4 uses the latest available data from
government surveys and high frequency phone surveys to show how the COVID-19
pandemic and the ability of countries and families to mitigate and remediate the
expected learning losses are likely to lead to significant shifts in learning inequality.
Section 16.5 discusses the types of education policy options that can help mitigate
and remediate the expected learning losses prioritizing disadvantaged students. The
last section summarizes.

16.2 A Learning Crisis Characterized by Huge Disparities
Between and Within Countries and Classrooms
Before COVID-19 hit, the world was facing a deep learning crisis with far too many
children failing to acquire the basic skills of literacy and numeracy. In fact, 53% of
children aged 10 did not know how to read and understand a simple text—what we
refer to as learning poverty.2 This high rate of learning poverty reflected the weakness of education systems worldwide; systems that have delivered improvements in
schooling but were not adequately organized to equip children with the foundational
skill of reading and hence unable to provide them with more complex skills in math,
science, and the humanities. Further, this high rate of learning poverty constrains
a country’s human-capital accumulation, jeopardizing long-term productivity and
growth.
The average learning poverty number hides immense variability in learning
outcomes both between regions and countries, and within them. For instance, while

database, The World Bank (October 2019)

learning poverty was 13% in Europe and Central Asia, it reached almost 80% of
children in Sub-Saharan Africa. Even within Europe and Central Asia—the region
with lowest learning poverty rates pre-pandemic—, results varied widely between
countries: from 64% in the Kyrgyz Republic to less than 2% in the Netherlands
(Fig. 16.1). Dramatic variations were also present within countries (Fig. 16.1). In
Brazil, a country that had 48% of children in learning poverty, the within country
spatial variation of learning poverty is striking, with rates ranging from the upper
80s in some North and North-Eastern municipalities, to lower 20s, in municipalities
in the state of Ceará,—which is also in the northeast—, or in Sao Paulo (Fig. 16.2).3
Children are different; they have different abilities, preferences, speeds of
learning, characters. Even in a classroom with little dispersion in socio-economic
conditions, there will be a significant heterogeneity in learning achievement. Teachers
must deal with this learning heterogeneity, part of which might be explained by
differences in socio-economic conditions, or innate ability. This can be illustrated by
a series of between- and within-group learning inequality decompositions using data
from international learning assessment such as PISA and TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study). Within countries, we observe significant
inequalities across the income scale, between urban and rural populations, between
girls and boys, and between students in public and private schools. In fact, rurality,
gender, income levels, and school characteristics (school fixed effects) accounted for,
on average, slightly more than half of the total inequality in learning as measured by

3 The learning poverty number at the municipal level within Brazil is not comparable to the global

learning poverty number. The municipal level estimations use the microdata from Prova Brasil 2017,
INEP School Census 2017 and IBGE population estimates. The National Minimum Proficiency
Level threshold used was 200 points in Portuguese. For more information on the learning results in
Ceará see Loureiro and Cruz (2020) and Loureiro et al. (2020).

Notes The learning poverty number for Brazil is calculated at the municipal level, using the microdata
from Prova Brasil 2017, INEP School Census 2017 and IBGE population estimates. The National
Minimum Proficiency Level threshold used was 200 points in Portuguese

standardized tests.4 It is important to note the significant heterogeneity of this result
across regions and countries. While in East Asia, the Middle East, the Pacific, and
Europe and Central Asia, this result varied from 30 to 70% of the total inequality. In
other regions, such as Latin America, such characteristics help explain 50–70% of
total inequality (see Fig. 16.13 for the range of results by regions).
Moreover, student experiences differ significantly within a country, reflecting
preexisting inequalities in learning opportunities, which over time reinforce and
exacerbate previous disparities. This potential increase in inequality within countries
might not be surprising if we look at what has happened in the past when there have
been system-wide changes in education performance. Historical data shows that
when educational systems improves (i.e., higher share of students above a minimum
proficiency level such as the SDG 4.1.1), it is usually a tide that raises all boats
(see the green column of Fig. 16.3 which shows that when learning proficiency
increased, changes in average scores were responsible for all progress). However,
when the share of proficient students falls, reductions are not the same across the
board but proportionally worse among those at the bottom of the learning distribution
4 Azevedo and Goldemberg (2020a).

(2020a). Note Countries can attain progress in increasing the share of pupils reaching learning proficiency either by improving the outcomes of the average student and/or by focusing in improving
the learning of those below the minimum proficiency level. The Figure contains a decomposition of
the change in the share of students who score above the Minimum Proficiency level (400 points in
the PISA scale) in reading using over 300 observations (each corresponding to a country and pair
of years of participation in PISA). See Fig. 16.14 for results per country)

(see the red column of Fig. 16.3 which shows that when proficiency deteriorate, the
changes in average scores and inequality each accounted for half of the worsening
scores).5 In other words, when learning declines, low performing students suffer
disproportionally more.
COVID-19 seems to be one large episode in which the share of students above
a minimum proficiency level will fall—as some early evidence already shows, as
discussed below. Historical data suggests that such past episodes have not been
distributionally neutral and have always disproportionally affected more students
at the bottom of the learning distribution. Mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on
learning disparities will call for the urgent design and implementation of specific
compensatory education policies.

16.3 Why is Learning Unequal and How Might COVID-19
Magnify Such Inequality?
This section develops a conceptual framework through a simple description of the
learning process, which can help explain pre-pandemic levels of learning inequality
and how COVID-19 might have magnified them. Most of the discussion in this

427

section is based on the well-established relationships between human capital, student
learning, and family and school inputs. The framework identifies the potential causal
mechanisms explaining the heterogeneous shock of COVID-19 on student learning.
Initial empirical analysis, underpinned by a simple theoretical framework already
shows that learning losses could be substantial and unequal, across countries and
within countries. For example, country-level estimations in Latin America and the
Caribbean, assuming 7-months of school closures, and learning loss mitigation
measures with low effectiveness, show that children could lose up to 88% of what
they would have learned in a regular school year, with those in the lowest income
quintile losing up to 95%.6 In another study, it is shown that if schools are closed
for a whole school year in Chile, students from the lowest income quintile could
lose up to 95% of their yearly learning while those in the highest income could lose
up to 64%.7 Simulations in Colombia show that even with partial school reopening,
fifth-grade students’ learning loss in the bottom quintile could double the top quintile’s loss (Fig. 16.4).8 Similar estimations hold for Costa Rica, where the poorest
students stand to lose close to an additional year of schooling than the richest.9
Outside of Latin America, simulations for Indonesia estimate that after four months
of school closures, the difference in reading outcomes in PISA between secondary

Change in learning poverty

and very low mitigation effectiveness in low- and middle-income countries, learning
poverty increases by 10 percentage points globally, from 53 to 63% (Fig. 16.6). SubSaharan Africa and Europe and Central Asia have the smallest absolute increase
of learning poverty (5 percentage points), while South Asia has the largest (17
percentage points), followed by Latin America (12 percentage points). Sub-Saharan
Africa also has the smallest relative increase (5 percentage points), while East Asia
and the Pacific and Europe and Central Asia have the largest (more than 30 percentage
points), suggesting that children in upper-middle-income and lower-middle-income
countries are likely to become the new learning poor.

16.3.1 The Technology of Skills Formation11
The stock of human capital or skills, knowledge, and experience of an individual
is the outcome of a complex, dynamic, cumulative process involving innate ability
and personality traits such as grit and motivation, and parental investment decisions.
Schooling is one of the most important parental investment decisions determining
student learning (T ) and therefore the stock of human capital of individuals. Parents
can invest in schooling by paying for the opportunity cost of children not working,
investing directly in private schooling, choosing a neighborhood partly based on the
quality of public schooling available or making other efforts to enroll their children
in a better school. Parental investments also determine the availability of household
assets conducive to learning such as learning material, a good learning environment
and access to technology. Learning outcomes of student “i” at age “a” are determined by his or her innate and immutable ability (μi ), and the flow of past parental
investments in the form of family and school inputs, F i (a) and Si (a), respectively12 :
Ti,a = Ta (F i (a), Si (a), μi )

(16.1)

Family and school inputs in Eq. (16.1) have a positive effect on learning outcomes
(∂ Ti /∂ F i , ∂ Ti /∂ Si > 0) and F i (a) and Si (a) are complements in the production of
learning (∂ 2 Ti /∂ F i ∂ Si > 0). These properties of the learning production function
have important implications for learning inequality and therefore the distribution of
future well-being. Children from better-off parents also enjoy more family inputs at
home such as books, technological devices, and most importantly, educated parents
creating a positive covariance between family and school inputs. Additionally, rich
parents can afford housing in a neighborhood with a high-quality public school or can
pay for private schooling with qualified teachers, learning materials, and motivated
and committed school directors. The concentration of family and school inputs in
better-off households defines the distribution of student learning. Applying D{.}, a
dispersion or distribution operator, to Eq. (16.1):
D{Ti } = T ' (D{F i }, D{Si }, D{μi })

(16.2)

The distribution of student learning is defined in terms of the distribution of past
flows of family and school inputs, innate abilities, and a covariance between the three
terms. Therefore, learning inequality in a point in time, is the outcome of the distribution of past and present family and school inputs, D{F i }, D{Si }. Alternatively, if the
population of interest is divided into K-mutually exclusive population subgroups,
D{Ti } can also be expressed in terms of differences in average inputs across the
subgroups, F̄(k), S̄(k), μ̄(k), and the dispersion of inputs within the subgroups,
11 For a formal discussion on skills formation see Cunha and Heckman (2007).
12 T
i,a is determined by Ti,(a−1) plus the parental investment at age “a” in the form of family and

school inputs, Fi (a) and Si (a). Substituting the parental investments in the flow of past student
learning outcomes results in Eq. (16.1).

D{F i (k)}, D{Si (k)}, D{μi (k)}. For instance, inequality in student learning around
the world can be expressed in terms of differences in the average level of inputs
between countries and how these inputs are distributed within them.
Expression (16.2) is also useful to identify the potential contribution of public
policy in shaping learning disparities. In the absence of interventions, the simple
human capital accumulation process developed here leads to a society with high
learning inequality. More equitable equilibriums require interventions to improve
the availability of family inputs among disadvantaged groups via social protection policies or the enactment of education policies to enhance inputs—teachers,
management, learning materials—in schools serving disadvantaged students. Cash
transfer programs can increase income levels, strengthen nutrition, and even improve
parenting through training, all of which can have a positive effect on student learning
of vulnerable groups.13 Other interventions might improve learning conditions at
home by distributing books, computers or other materials to children’s households,
providing parental training on how to stimulate children and encourage learning
at home, and compensate the large inequality in home environments conducive to
learning. A more direct and effective way to improving learning outcomes among
disadvantaged students is to expand the availability and quality of inputs in schools
serving this marginalized groups. Having a physical space dedicated to teaching and
learning with an adequate environment and pedagogical materials, and with professionals trained to teach and mentor students, has proven to be a very effective way
to improve learning and provide opportunities to poor and disadvantaged students.14
In many cases, this equalizing social space disappeared.

16.3.2 COVID-19, Student Learning and Learning
Inequality15
Our simple framework of skills formation helps identify the impact of COVID19 on student learning, which operates through the pandemic’s impact on family,
school inputs, and government response. All these effects are mediated by the initial
distribution of inputs and innate abilities such as perseverance and self-control. In
other words, the pandemic can affect the distribution of student learning through
three main channels: (1) shifting school inputs, through the choice of the duration
and nature of schools closures; (2) the scale and effectiveness of public policies put in
place by governments and private providers to mitigate and remediate these schools
closures; and (3) the initial family distribution of endowments that can complement

13 There is some evidence showing that well-targeted conditional cash transfer programs have

positive, though small, effects on student learning.

school inputs which will become particularly important as learning moves to the
home.
According to the World Bank (2021), the world economy was expected to decrease
by 5% during 2020—the worse decline since the Great Depression—with many jobs
lost, wages cut, and an immediate drop in households’ well-being. This macro shock
reduced the availability of family inputs, F i (a), which in turn could have reduced
students learning outcomes in the short- and long-run. Family inputs are particularly
important for the physical and social development of small children going through a
critical developmental period.16 The average economic shock of the pandemic hides
important distributional impacts with households in the lower part of the income
distribution bearing a larger share of the burden.17 This is partly explained by the
unequal possibility across individuals to work from home, which, in turn, is related
to differences in occupations and availability of a computer with internet connection
at home. Occupations intensive in the use of technology, usually paired with high
levels of education, had an easier transition to home-based work. However, less than
a third of household heads in developing countries had an occupation that lent itself
to be performed through home-based work18 and this share is significantly smaller
once the availability of internet at home is accounted for.19,20
A more evident link between COVID-19 and student learning is through its effects
on school inputs, Si (a). Many countries shut down schools to try to reduce the spread
of the virus. Education systems had to struggle to use the available resources to
continue the learning process, most of them relying on multiple platforms for remote
learning, including the use of the internet, mobile phones, T.V., radio, and social
media. Given that school inputs were not meant to be used in a context of school
closures, lockdowns resulted in a loss of efficiency and productivity, reducing student
learning almost immediately. There is plenty of evidence, prior to the COVID-19
pandemic, documenting the negative effects of school closures on student learning.
Studies exploiting the “summer meltdown,” variations in the number of school days
due to teachers’ strikes, or extreme climate conditions, show that fewer school days
reduce student learning outcomes in core subject areas like math and language.21
COVID-19 has also significantly impacted governments’ fiscal space, affecting
the availability and distribution of funding for the education sector, and the ability of
countries to deploy public policies to prevent the worsening of the learning distributions. Before the pandemic, governments were spending vastly different amounts on
16 A recent paper analyzing the effects of the 2005 earthquake in Pakistan, which resulted in schools

being closed for several months, shows that children between 0 and 3 years of age at the time of
the quake show lower learning outcomes even 4 years after the shock (Andrabi et al., 2021).

20 Additionally, a significant share of urban households with pre-pandemic incomes under the
poverty line derived incomes from activities in the informal sector with little or no scope for
working from home (Alfaro et al., 2020).

education. In low-income countries, the pandemic is expected to reduce education
spending in 2021.22 Some countries are already cutting their education budgets to
make space for the required spending on health and social protection. For example,
in Ukraine, the education budget is set for a cut of around 4% or US$217 million
in 2020 to make more space to deal with COVID-19 related shocks. Reports from
Nigeria also suggest that revisions to the federal budget will cut approximately 45%
(US$130 million) of the budget for the Universal Basic Education Commission. In
Kenya, policymakers have identified both development spending on tertiary education and basic education curriculum reform as necessary cuts to support the country’s
COVID-19 response.
School closures, changes in education budgets and the education policies put
in place by governments around the world had a large effect on learning disparities. While there was an overall loss in efficiency of school inputs, less well-off
students were in a worse position to weather the storm. Affluent schools were better
prepared for remote learning with a more intensive use of technology before the
pandemic. With classrooms empty, good teachers and education technology depend
on educated parents and availability of inputs (e.g., electricity, connectivity, internet,
mobile phone, TV, radio, paper-based-assignments, and books) at home to reach
students and produce learning. School closures together with remote learning strategies increased the complementary nature between family and school inputs, making
unequal household conditions a more salient determinant of learning inequality.
In developing countries, most students do not have the minimum conditions to
learn at home. For instance, in Mexico, an upper middle-income country, only half
of the students in basic education—from preschool to 9th grade—had access to a
technological device connected to the internet from home, with this share being less
than 25% among students from poor households. Having a device with access to the
internet provides students access to online learning and a vast amount of knowledge,
but it is not enough to learn. For learning to happen while schools are closed, students,
particularly young ones, need an adult (parent or caregiver) with enough time and
schooling to teach, guide, and encourage them at home.23 Differences in the schooling
level and availability of time among parents or caregivers among poor and nonpoor households is one of the most important sources behind the unequal effect of
COVID-19 on student learning.
The combination of lack of access to a device with an internet connection, and
parents with low education levels and working in the informal sector with little or
no time to assist their children in the learning process, makes the impact of school
closures highly regressive. The pandemic’s regressive effect on family and school
inputs combine and reinforce each other to have a significant interruption of the
learning trajectories of poor and disadvantaged students. When governments decided
to close schools, families changed their behavior to try to cushion the learning disruptions of this decision, but only well-off household had the resources to mitigate the

shock. Highly educated parents in better-off families with secure jobs in the formal
sector devoted more time to their children’s learning process or invested in private
tutoring. Poor households did not have the means to adapt to the new circumstances,
absorbing most of the learning shock. While shutting down schools, societies were
also shutting down a great social leveler and perhaps one of the few feasible options
to escape poverty.24

16.4 What the Data Shows: How Can COVID-19 Impact
Learning Inequality?
This section builds on the conceptual framework introduced in the previous section
to provide initial systematic evidence on how the COVID-19 pandemic might impact
learning inequality. This section is organized around three main guiding questions,
namely: (i) How unequal have COVID-19 school closures been? (ii) How might the
current ability of governments to respond to the pandemic affect COVID-19’s impact
on learning inequality? and (iii) How are pre-crisis inequalities likely to affect the
ability of households to ensure learning continuity?

16.4.1 How Unequal Have the COVID-19 School Closures
Been?
The COVID-19 shock did not affect all countries at the same point of the school
year, and offered hugely different conditions for governments to plan, prepare and
deploy their mitigation and remediation strategies. In some countries, mostly in the
Northern Hemisphere, school closures disrupted the end of a school year; in others,
school closures delayed the start of the school year; in still others, school closures
coincided with a previously scheduled break. Government’s decisions regarding the
length of school closures have also varied substantially with some countries closing
schools for close to a year now, while some closed them for less than 2 months
(Fig. 16.7). Figure 16.7 plots the duration of school closures for a selection of countries chosen to underscore the variety of situations. However, it should be noted that
even neighboring countries in the same region experienced vastly different durations
and timing of school closure.
24 Glewwe et al. (2017) finds no evidence that schools in Vietnam are more effective for advantaged

students. Indeed, the one significant effect is that girls, who some consider disadvantaged, pull ahead
of boys between age 5 and 10. In contrast, for two definitions of disadvantage, schools in Peru appear
to be more effective for advantaged students. Vietnam’s expansion in primary education in the last 2
decades included effective investment in education quality and a focus on equity, emphasizing that
all pupils attain “minimum standards.” In contrast, Peru’s schools suffer from low average quality
and high inequality in student learning, with evidence of gaps in access and learning outcomes by,
for example, income and ethnicity.

In addition, unequal impacts of COVID-19 across gender will also play a significant role in shaping the effect of the pandemic on learning inequality. With schools
closed, young girls in low-income settings could spend more time looking after their
younger siblings and engaging in other household chores leading to increased disengagement, less learning and eventually higher school dropout.25 The rise in anxiety,
stress, intra-household violence, and child abuse and neglect, often associated with
economic insecurity, will have long-lasting negative impacts on student learning,
particularly socio-emotional skills.26
There is little evidence regarding the impact of current school closures over
learning. However, the mounting evidence—mostly from rich countries—points to
relatively low and unequal effectiveness of remote learning. Evidence from a few
European countries for which there is learning data post-school closures shows a
significant loss of learning, with disadvantaged students suffering the most. In the
Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland, despite almost universal access to online
services, researchers found a decrease in student performance and growing inequality,
likely due to children from better-off families receiving more parental support and
having better remote learning environments.27 In the U.S., regardless of the type of
college, enrollment rates for low-income high school students plunged by 29% in

(Table 16.1).28

16.4.2 How Might the Current Ability of Governments
to Respond to the Pandemic Affect Its Impact
on Learning Inequality?
The government responses to these shocks have also been tremendously unequal.
First, even if most countries responded to school closures by attempting different
mechanisms of remote learning, the access and effectiveness of these efforts has
varied widely. Low-income countries relied more frequently on one-way communication strategies, such as radio and TV, while high-income countries are using twoway communication strategies, such as online platforms, leveraged by take-home
packages of educational material.
The difference in response, in terms of distance education mechanisms and length
of school closures, points to very different experiences between countries, most likely
generating a larger divergence in learning inequality between rich and poor countries.
Additionally, within countries, different conditions in school and at home have led
to dramatically different experiences for children. Suddenly, and faster than expected,

many teachers were required to become technology experts, digitally connecting
with their students, and creating alternative learning routines using digital platforms.
If their students had internet access and conditions to work at home, they were
able to partially compensate for the lack of in-person classes. Other teachers, whose
students only had access to a shared smartphone among different household members,
had greater difficulties. These students could follow educational programming on
television or radio, but with several siblings in a small house and little room to
concentrate, in addition to no space to interact with teachers to ask questions, they
had more difficulty learning. And many other students completely disengaged from
the educational process. Some students—in countries as diverse as Indonesia, Kenya,
and Colombia—were able to easily cope with the changes after schools closed, but
not the majority. 2020 marks a different childhood experience that these young people
will remember for the rest of their lives, one that will impact their skills and economic
prospects for the rest of their lives.
A UNESCO-UNICEF-World Bank Joint survey of school closures applied in late
2020 asked Ministries of Education what policies were being put in place to prevent
the exclusion of learners without access to remote learning. As mentioned above,
most countries implemented multiplatform strategies, with very different patterns
across countries. The differences between countries are striking. One third of lowincome countries (33) have declared that they have not taken any measures to reduce
the risk of students ‘exclusion from remote learning, a result that is six times higher
compared to high-income countries (Fig. 16.8). High and middle-income countries
were significantly more likely to roll out measures that would entail flexible and
self-paced platforms. These platforms ranged from asynchronous learning platforms

support learners in need and those at risk of dropout and disengagement.29

16.4.3 How Are Families’ and Household’s Pre-COVID
Inequalities and Post-COVID Behavior Likely
to Magnify the Learning Crisis?
As described above, the economic shock that resulted from COVID-19 has been
highly unequally distributed between and within countries, with households in the
lower part of the income distribution bearing a larger share of the burden. The unequal
distribution of the economic shock is partly explained by pre-pandemic differences in
labor market conditions, with formal, high-skilled, occupations lending themselves
to be performed at home and more precarious ones more exposed to lockdowns. As
shown in Fig. 16.9, less than a third of households in developing countries—to the left
of the vertical line in Fig. 16.9—had an occupation that lends itself to be performed
through home-based work.30 Additionally, a significant share of urban households

with pre-pandemic incomes under the poverty line derived incomes from informal
sector activities with little or no scope for working from home.31
The occupational characteristics of individuals in poor households made them less
adept to lockdowns, bearing a disproportional shock from the pandemic. Evidence
from previous economic crises shows that student learning suffers from negative
income shocks.32 Parents have less time and resources to make sure that there are
minimum household conditions for learning; in low-income settings, nutritional
inputs can be compromised, or children might be encouraged to enter the labor
market, all of which reduces student learning.
A second pre-pandemic inequality shaping the learning incidence of COVID-19 is
the availability of devices with access to the internet. Figure 16.10 shows the highly
unequal distribution of access to a mobile phone or internet between and within
countries. Mobile ownership reaches 94% in high income countries, and only 61%
in low-income countries. Internet access reaches 87% in rich countries but only 24%
in poorer ones. Moreover, within countries inequality in access varies dramatically.
In rich countries for example, access to internet does not differ much between the
bottom 60% and the top 40% in the income scale. In low-income countries, access
rates double among the top 40%.
Perhaps the most important element shaping the unequal learning impacts of
the pandemic is the pre-existing differences in parental schooling. More educated
parents were not only more adept to changes in labor market conditions, but they

were also more likely to have the content knowledge to help their children during
home schooling. Parents or caregivers with more education are also more aware
of the importance that learning outcomes play in shaping their children’s future
labor market opportunities which encouraged them to actively participate in home
schooling activities. Figure 16.11 shows the learning engagement level of students for
countries in different regions by the highest level of education of adults in the household. Once again, both between- and within-group learning inequalities are likely
to increase, as the level of learning engagement during the pandemic is drastically
higher for children of highly educated parents. While more than 80% of students
from households with a highly educated adult (tertiary education) have remained
engaged in learning during the period of school closures, engagement is much lower
in households with adults with lower education levels. In several countries, students
from households where adults had no education were 3 to 4 times less likely to be
engaged in a learning activity during the same period.

16.5 Education Policies to Mitigate and Remediate
Learning Losses
As we saw in the previous sections, COVID-19 not only led to decreased learning but
likely resulted in a learning inequality catastrophe. Countries urgently need to implement compensatory measures to avoid turning the temporary shock into a permanent
one. Some of these measures can be implemented once schools re-open, while others
need to be implemented as soon as possible, complementing remote learning interventions. Certainly, all the compensatory policies need a careful design, training for
those responsible for implementing them on the ground, a rollout strategy, and above
all, the necessary financial resources and political leadership.
In the short-term, a critical task of education systems is to avoid that the potential
impacts of COVID-19 described above transform into student disengagement and an
eventual school dropout. Therefore, compensatory education policies should identify
and reach out to students suffering the most and keep them engaged to ensure that
they return to school once re-open. As shown in Fig. 16.12, strategies to encourage
reenrollment include information and communication campaigns, financial and nonfinancial incentives, early warning systems with targeted support interventions, and
special education programs for pregnant girls when banned from school.
Once schools re-open, at least in a hybrid way, the focus should be on compensating learning losses and providing more support for those students that suffered
the most from the pandemic. To help those with the biggest learning gaps catch-up,
countries can measure the extent and the incidence of the learning loss and implement compensatory education policies including additional teaching time, specific
pedagogies targeted at those furthest behinds (such as teaching to the right level
methodologies), tutoring or accelerated learning programs (see Fig. 16.12).33
Given fiscal and operational limitations, it is important to ensure that resources are
allocated efficiently. One option is for Ministries of Education to implement a combination of system-wide responses to address the generalized learning loss at a national
level (such as streamlining the curriculum)34 and more targeted strategies (such as
tutoring and teaching to the right level) to tackle the inequality of the learning loss. For
the targeted strategies, Ministries could consider allocating resources and technical
assistance to schools based on their share of disadvantaged students. In low-capacity
contexts, it might be necessary to provide direct support to schools to implement the
compensatory measures, with the support of NGOs (non-governmental organizations) or volunteers. In contexts where the school and regional levels have the necessary capacity, Ministries could consider creating a menu of compensatory options
and transferring funds to schools or districts to select the compensatory measures
that might work best for their student population. The selection of context-adequate
compensatory options could be done with the technical guidance of central-level
33 Mundy and Hares (2020).
34 For instance, France will provide teachers with guides explaining the prioritized objectives for

the grade once schools open in the fall.

education authorities. The remaining elements of this section describe some education interventions for which there is some evidence showing that they effectively
increase student reenrollment and, once in school, improve learning.

16.5.1 Compensatory Measures to Increase Reenrollment
To avoid disengagement with the learning process and increase reenrollment, policymakers can consider providing information to students and parents on the availability
of distance education programs, school re-opening plans, school safety protocols,
and income-earning benefits of education. In their most basic form, information
and awareness campaigns can inform parents of the available distance or hybrid
education programs, school re-opening plans (e.g., dates, location), and the process
to get children back to school.35 To tackle the fear of contagion while in schools,
campaigns can also involve messaging regarding school safety protocols and on
showing the evidence of low transmission of COVID-19 for the youngest. Importantly, including specific and context-relevant information on the returns to education might be useful in increasing enrollment (and attainment) in contexts where
that information shifts the beliefs of youth and parents (for instance, where youth
have limited exposure to highly educated individuals in their communities that are
successful in the labor market).36 The latter has been tested positively in small-scale
interventions in Madagascar, Peru, and the Dominican Republic.37
The provision of information cannot wait for schools to re-open; communications must be continuous so that the linkage between the student and the school
stays active and disengagement is averted. For instance, an RCT (randomized clinical trial) in Pakistan is evaluating the effect of an intervention that includes lesson
plans, SMS (Short Messaging Services), and phone messages to encourage take-up
of distance education; as well as SMS with information on school re-opening plans,
school scholarships, the returns of learning, and other social returns to encourage reenrollment.38 Re-enrollment campaigns are also being implemented in Madagascar,
Ethiopia, Pakistan, and Sierra Leone, focusing on students most at risk of dropping
out (girls and students from marginalized communities). The Philippines is implementing a multi-pronged strategy to bring children back to school, which involves
more flexible enrollment procedures, teachers tracking each student’s enrollment,
and a strong media campaign (involving Facebook, Twitter, local T.V., and radio).39

Early-warning systems (EWS) could be used to identify children and youth at
risk of disengaging with learning and not returning to school and providing them
targeted support. EWS uses data on risk factors that contribute to dropout (e.g.,
attendance, academic achievement) to identify students at risk and provide them with
interventions to help them stay in school. These interventions can include SMS/calls
to encourage children to participate in distance learning, provide them with distance
learning materials, and notify parents when children do not engage or do not reenroll;
virtual (online, phone, SMS) one-on-one support from teachers or volunteers; extracurricular activities; mentoring schemes; remediation classes; psychosocial support;
counseling; or even monetary and non-monetary incentives. EWS is most effective in
countries where there is sufficient student data, where dropout is not widespread, and
where schools can support students that are identified as at risk.40 In fact, while they
have reduced absenteeism in the USA (United States of America), in the Netherlands,
in Cambodia, and in Serbia (albeit in a small-scale pilot), they have not been impactful
in Tajikistan, India, and Timor-Leste.41 To respond to COVID-19, Salvador (Brazil) is
combining accelerated learning recovery programs with the system-wide expansion
of an EWS where Agentes da Educação monitor school attendance and visit families
of at-risk youth to prevent dropout.42
Although the impact has not yet been widely measured, multiple countries are
using technology-enabled support to complement distance education delivery for the
most vulnerable during COVID-19. In Italy, the provision of 3.6 weekly hours of free
individual online tutoring by volunteer university students significantly impacted
students’ academic performance, socio-emotional skills, and psychological wellbeing. Importantly, the effects were greater for those of lower socio-economic backgrounds and immigrants.43 In Botswana, weekly SMS with math problems and 15–
20-min phone calls to walk through the problems significantly increased student
learning during school closures.44 Similar interventions are being tested in other
countries. In Bangladesh, researchers are evaluating the effect of SMS messages,
teacher outreach, and a reduction of internet cost over student engagement with
the governments’ distance learning platform, student learning, and socio-emotional
wellbeing. In Ecuador, researchers evaluate the effect of sending SMS reminders to
encourage students to complete their online training along with incentives (a weekly
lottery ticket for a prize upon completing learning modules) and benchmarking for
underperforming students. In Ghana, an RCT is testing the impact of sending SMS
messages that suggest activities to promote socio-emotional development at home
and encourage remote learning. In Guatemala, the impact of radio skits with early
childhood stimulation messages and voice messages to encourage uptake is also
being evaluated. Finally, the impact of SMS reminders to listen to the radio distance

program and a complimentary phone tutorial by teachers is being evaluated in Sierra
Leone.45
When the reasons for not returning to schools are financial, it might be useful to
offer incentives that offset the financial opportunity costs of returning and increase the
immediate benefits of getting back to school. These incentives can be financial (such
as awarding scholarships, fee waivers, or conditional cash transfers) or non-financial
(such as free school meals or materials—e.g., books, uniforms, meals, transport,
radios, tablets).46 Properly targeted cash transfers have consistently shown positive
effects on enrollment and dropout rates in contexts where school participation is
low.47 For them to be impactful, it is crucial to target children that might not continue
schooling otherwise because of financial pressures or high opportunity costs outside
school. Scholarships can be ineffective when not well-targeted or when the real
constraint driving dropouts is academic rather financial.48
After the Ebola crisis, Sierra Leone drove re-enrollment rates to 95% by
ensuring minimum safety protocols (soap, veronica buckets), using massive awareness campaigns (radio jingles, back-to-school committees with parents), training on
the provision of psychosocial support, and waiving school fees including children’s’
books. In response to COVID-19, multiple countries are providing similar incentives.
For instance, UNICEF is working with Airtel Africa in 13 sub-Saharan African countries to provide mobile cash transfers to families of 133 million school-aged children
encouraging reenrollment and online learning.49
Offering pregnant girls special education programs can also be critical to increase
engagement with schooling and re-enrollment, especially in countries with a ban
on pregnant girls attending school. During the Ebola crisis of 2014, Sierra Leonean
schools were closed for eight months. Upon re-opening, girls ages 12–17 were 16
percentage points less likely to be in school. Child labor by girls increased by 19
percentage points.50 In some communities, teenage pregnancy increased by up to 65%
due to the socio-economic conditions imposed by the outbreak.51 During that time,
the country had banned visibly pregnant girls from returning to schools or sitting
for examinations. This led to a generation of young mothers that saw their future
truncated. Thankfully, in March 2020, the government reversed this ban and implemented the Zero Schoolgirl Pregnancy Campaign that involves strong messaging to
Chiefs, religious leaders, the police, nurses, parents, teachers, and girls themselves
around the importance of protecting and investing in girls, enhancing sexual reproductive health education; reducing maternal teenage death to zero; enhancing school
completion and transition, and supporting the health of girls.52

16.5.2 Compensatory Measures to Catch up Lost Learning
Countries must start by assessing student learning to understand how to best align
their practices and teaching material to the students’ needs. In countries where a
sufficiently recent learning assessment is available, it should be possible to design
a temporary comparable instrument and use it to measure the extent of the learning
losses.53 Countries need to understand both the extent of the learning loss and whether
all students in each classroom/school/district/or country were impacted similarly.
Countries do not have to wait until school re-opening to measure the current level of
learning their students, and potentially their learning loss. For instance, the Ministry
of Education and Technical Education of Egypt adapted their examinations so that
students in grades 3–9 are evaluated through open-book multidisciplinary research
projects done from home, and students in grades 10–11 rely on computer-based tests
from home.54 Ghana and Rwanda will also test remote formative assessments using
basic mobile phone technologies to support learning outside of physical classrooms.
France plans to follow a more traditional route by conducting early year assessments
for grades 1, 6 and 12, and providing sample tests for teachers to assess student
learning at a classroom level.55
Increasing the instructional time might be a way to catch up on lost learning
during closures. This could entail having a greater number of hours each school
day (through longer school days or shorter recess time), extending the school week
(through weekend school), offering summer school, or having an early school start or
late school end. The school day’s expansion has shown consistently positive impacts
on learning in the United States, Ethiopia, Peru, Chile, Colombia, Uruguay, and
Argentina.56 Rigorous global evidence suggests that summer or after school programs
can lead to important learning gains for the most disadvantaged.57 According to the
UNESCO, UNICEF, World Bank Survey of National Education Response to COVID19 School closures, almost a quarter of educational systems plan to increase class
time in the second half of the year.58 For example, France allocated e200 million
to provide “learning vacations,” which will be fully-funded for children of modest
backgrounds. Through this program, one million children can go to their regular
schools, a summer camp in the countryside or coastal areas, learning summer camps,
or learning leisure centers to catch up on learning and play.59
53 UIS and ACER have recently designed a strategy for Monitoring the Impacts on Learning

Outcomes (MILO), using recently implemented Regional Learning Assessment, such as PASEC
(2019) or National Learning Assessments as baselines, and designing temporally comparable
instruments.

Individual students that are particularly behind their peers might require dedicated attention, such as one-to-one or small group tutoring, once schools re-open.60
Existing evidence shows that high-dosage tutoring (at least 4 times per week) with
a small group of students (less than 6 children) substantially impacts learning, especially if conducted during school hours.61 For instance, having recent college graduates provide one-to-one tutoring to high school students in Boston for four days
per week led to learning gains equivalent to one or two additional years of math in
a single school year, above and beyond what students typically learn. In Niger and
Nigeria, a 6 h per week tutoring program targeting displaced and refugee children
also had significant impacts on student’s reading and math, especially when accompanied with socio-emotional learning activities (mindfulness and Brain games).62
Programs that combine cognitive-behavioral therapy with academic tutoring have
also shown substantial effects on students’ dropout rates in at-risk communities
in the United States and Canada.63 However, a math tutoring intervention and a
cognitive-behavioral therapy-based program in Mexico, which had limited take-up,
found mixed effects on socio-emotional skills and no effect on math scores.64 When
designing tutoring programs, incentives must be carefully designed. As documented
by several scholars, private tutoring can cause negative distortions on the education
system when teachers offer for-profit tutoring to their same students. This gives them
a pervasive incentive to teach less during their regular classes to generate demand
for tutoring.65
To respond to COVID-19, 62% of countries plan to introduce a dedicated remedial
program. For instance, England set up a £1 billion fund with two branches: £350
million will be directed to ensure the most disadvantaged pupils can access tutors
over the year, and £650 million will be directed to primary and secondary schools
who will have the choice to provide additional 1-on-1 or group tutoring for any pupils
that they identify need it.66 France will fund 1.5 million additional teaching hours
so that all students have the option of taking at least 3 h of homework support per
week under the Devoirs faits program (which offers voluntary homework support).67
The Philippines also issued a plan where students who earn less than a 75% grade
receive remedial classes for six weeks. As an alternative, schools have the option to
organize make-up classes for the upcoming year.68

Initiatives to target instruction by learning level, instead of grade or age, are
worth considering as an alternative to catch-up on learning. These programs involve
grouping students by their level of knowledge with instruction designed to continuously assess their progress and scaffold knowledge to advance to the next level.
Different modalities involve grouping students for all or part of the school day;
grouping them during school, in after-school classes, or during summer-camps;
relying on government teachers, volunteers, or teaching assistants. These programs
have been implemented successfully in several settings, including Kenya, Ghana,
Zambia, India, and Brazil.69 Under the Acelera Brasil program, students were divided
into separate classes according to their needs. Those that were lagging the most
received supplementary classes that allowed them to catch up. Within five years,
52% of participating students in the State of Paraíba passed more than one grade and
rejoined their appropriate age group. In the State of Pernambuco, the dropout rate
was significantly lower than the average after the program was implemented (3.2%
vs. 14.8%). In the State of Tocantins, 99% of the program graduates were promoted
to the next level.70 In India’s Balsakhi Program, a tutor from the local community
worked with a group of 15–20 children who were falling behind their peers for two
hours each day (out of the 4 total school hours). In this time, the tutor focused on
improving core competencies having substantial positive impacts on learning.71
Computer-assisted software can aid in tailoring instruction to the students’ needs
and can be used while schools are closed and relying on online platforms to deliver
distance learning. For instance, in an intervention in Vadodara (India), which had
statistically significant improvements in learning outcomes, grade four students
accessed two hours of shared computer time per week to play math games that
responded to their ability.72 Another rigorously studied intervention with very positive impacts provided after school instruction 6 days per week, with 45 min of individual self-driven learning using the Mindspark app, followed by 45 min of guided
group learning (using a teaching assistant and 12–15 students).73 Similar interventions in advanced countries (and in Uruguay at a national level) have also found positive results, particularly for the most vulnerable.74 Post COVID-19, the Government
of Ecuador plans to improve students’ academic readiness with important curricular
knowledge gaps by providing Adaptive Computer Assisted Remediation Programs
for 12 months to 16,000 first-year students in 90 technical institutes nationwide.75
Finally, accelerated learning programs can reduce learning inequality. These
programs aim to complete the education outcomes in a shorter period and normally
provide an alternative route to return to learning for those behind their age-peers after
dropping out of education. Such programs have been implemented in Afghanistan,

Bangladesh, Brazil, Burundi, Cambodia, Ghana, Honduras, Liberia, Malawi, Sierra
Leone, Tanzania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Ethiopia, among others.
Most of these interventions have focused on primary, small multi-age, and multigrade classes. In several cases, community-based volunteers have been used as facilitators, who were supported with detailed lesson plans and a streamlined curriculum
focusing on foundational and relevant learning. Often, these programs have started
with mother-tongue instruction, for at least 3–4 h per day, and were introduced as a
time-bound response to a crisis (e.g., conflict). Some of them have been successful
in terms of access, completion, retention, and learning.76
Although interventions were exposed separately, governments will likely need to
design a package of multiple interventions to keep students engaged, get them to
reenroll and support them in staying and succeeding at school. These interventions
might complement each other, as seen in a multifaceted program in India which
involved door-to-door campaigns to enroll girls who had either dropped out or had
never enrolled in school, activity-based and playful teaching to students grouped by
ability, stronger school management communities, and work with the community to
promote girls’ education. This intervention was successful in increasing enrollment
(8% in the first year and 12% in the second), reducing gender gaps in school retention, increasing learning (0.3 s.d. in the first year and 0.16 in the second year) and
improving school management.77

16.6 Concluding Remarks
Learning depends on a set of school and family inputs, and innate ability and motivation. Variances in the availability of those inputs will generate different learning
outcomes. The availability of both family and school inputs differ by income and
socioeconomic status and the effects of these two inputs is compounded by the
complementarity between them. On one hand, more equitable equilibriums require
interventions to improve the availability of family inputs among disadvantaged
groups via social protection policies or direct assistance to improve learning conditions at home (connectivity, devices, learning materials). On the other hand, governments need to enact education policies to enhance inputs (teachers, management,
learning materials) in schools serving disadvantaged students.
When governments decided to close schools, the highly unequal distribution of
family inputs both between and within countries, such as access to a mobile phone
or internet and parental levels of education, took on greater importance. Differences in school inputs were already generating inequality of opportunities before
the pandemic. But now, differences in conditions at home started being more relevant in defining variation in education opportunities. As shown here, there are large
differences in the availability in critical inputs across countries and within them. For

example, internet access reaches 87% in rich countries but only 24% in poorer ones.
Moreover, inequality in access varies dramatically within countries. In rich countries
for example, access to internet does not differ much between the bottom 60% and
the top 40% in the income scale. In low-income countries access rates are double for
the top 40%.
But the difference in these inputs interacts with the differences in parental education. We find that engagement level of students varies markedly according to the level
of education of adults in the household. Learning inequalities are likely to increase,
as the level of learning engagement during the pandemic is drastically higher for
children of highly educated parents. While more than 80% of students from households with a highly educated adult (tertiary education) have remained engaged in
learning during the period of school closures, engagement is much lower in households with adults with lower education levels; in several of the countries, students
from a less well-off background (adults with no education) were 3–4 times less likely
to be engaged in a learning activity during the same period.
Learning data post-pandemic is not available yet, except for a few European
countries which report learning losses equivalent to the extent of the school closures
and highly unequal, despite smaller differences in family and school inputs, along
the income scale. Using data for some middle-income countries, we complement
this analysis with simulations of learning losses by quintile of income. If schools are
closed for a whole school year in Chile, students from the lowest income quintile
could lose up to 95% of their yearly learning while those in the highest quintile
could lose up to 64%. Simulations for Colombia show that even with partial school
reopening, fifth-grade students’ learning loss in the bottom quintile could double
the top quintile’s loss. In Indonesia it is estimated that after only four months of
school closures, the difference in reading outcomes in PISA between secondary
school students in the richest and the poorest quintile will increase from 1.4 years of
schooling to 1.6 years of schooling.
COVID-19 is not only leading to potentially lower learning but likely resulting
in a learning inequality catastrophe. Hence, countries urgently need to implement
compensatory measures to avoid turning the temporary increases in inequality into
permanent ones. Some of these measures can be implemented once schools re-open,
while others need to be implemented as soon as possible, complementing remote
learning interventions.
In the short-term, a critical task of education systems is to avoid that the potential
impacts of COVID-19 described above transform from student disengagement and an
eventual school dropout. Therefore, compensatory education policies should identify
and reach out to students suffering the most and keep them engaged to ensure that
they return to school once they re-open. Strategies to encourage reenrollment include
information and communication campaigns, financial and non-financial incentives,
early warning systems with targeted support interventions, and special education
programs for pregnant girls when banned from school.
Once schools re-open, at least in a hybrid way, the focus should be on compensating learning losses. To help those with the biggest learning gaps catch-up, countries

450

need to urgently measure the extent and the incidence of the learning loss and implement compensatory education policies, including additional teaching time, specific
pedagogies targeted at those furthest behind (such as teaching to the right level
methodologies), and tutoring or accelerated learning programs.

Conclusions and Implications
Fernando M. Reimers

Abstract This chapter concludes the book, drawing on the preceding chapters to
identify overarching themes that summarize the nature of the educational impact of
COVID-19. It describes the educational loss that was created by the pandemic, particularly for disadvantaged students and more so in countries with lower levels of per
capita income. Those losses were the result of impacts of the pandemic on poverty and
household conditions, as well as the result of insufficient capacity of remote instruction to adequately sustain opportunity to learn. The efforts to maintain educational
opportunity and to close equity gaps during the pandemic in some countries are also
discussed, in the context of the role of educational inequality before the pandemic
and of initial conditions to support remote instruction. The chapter examines also
some of the silver linings resulting from the pandemic in the education sector, such
as the greater recognition of the importance of schools, and of in person schooling,
and the necessity to support the emotional and social development of students, in
addition to their cognitive development. The chapter concludes discussing the challenges ahead created by the pandemic and underscores the urgency of maintaining
the priority of education and remediating those learning losses during the remaining
period of the pandemic and in the immediate aftermath, to mitigate the likely increase
in poverty and social inequality that would result from the educational losses during
COVID-19.

17.1 The Educational Consequences of COVID-19 Differed
by Country and Class
The COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented challenge for educators and
education systems around the world. The impact of the pandemic on the conditions
in which students live, the risks to their health, and the impact of the economic
recession on their families increased the challenges for students in finding the time,

space, and focus to study. In addition, the adoption of social distancing measures
and alternative ways to educate remotely when in-person instruction was interrupted
reduced opportunities to learn and caused many students not only to struggle to learn
what was expected in the curriculum, but to lose skills and knowledge they had
previously gained and to disengage with learning.
At the same time, for some students, the experience of learning in different ways
during the pandemic provided the opportunity to gain new knowledge and develop
new skills. It provided an opportunity to gain more autonomy in learning, to spend
more time with their families, and to learn together with their families. Parents gained
knowledge from this increased engagement in the education of their children and
time spent together focusing on the work they did in school and their own children’s
learning experience. Similarly, teachers gained greater knowledge about the home
circumstances of their students because of the necessary collaboration with their
parents. As shown in Chap. 15, studies in France, the United States, the United
Kingdom, and Ireland reveal that parents spent more time assisting their children
with schoolwork during the pandemic than before, but only about half of them felt
adequately prepared to do so. For teachers, the strategies of remote learning likely
increased their Digi-pedagogies, while increasing students’ knowledge of how to
learn remotely, although for many the approach was ‘sink or swim’, with limited
support, hardly adequate to develop optimal proficiency or confidence.
These effects differed greatly among children in different socioeconomic circumstances, among different types of schools, and among different countries. For individual students, the educational effects of the pandemic were mediated by other
conditions, mainly the education and resources of their parents. Some of these conditions were in turn aggravated by the pandemic—as poverty and social inequality
increased, and as children in large families who shared limited space and connectivity resources at home had less space, time, and peace of mind to study as they
were confined to their homes, where they had to study.
The differences of success in managing the spread of the virus across countries
resulting from differences in the quality of political and public health leadership,
differences in health infrastructure, risks, and financial and institutional resources
resulted in considerable variation across countries in the duration of the period when
in-person instruction was replaced with remote options. Furthermore, differences
in technological infrastructure, access to connectivity, and previous experience and
knowledge of Digi-pedagogies resulted in differences across countries, and among
students within the same countries, in the amount of engaged learning time experienced by different students. While there are very few reliable estimates of how
much learning took place during the pandemic, or of how much learning was lost,
the available evidence shows considerable learning loss and greater loss for students
from disadvantaged backgrounds, accentuated in countries with greater percentage
of disadvantaged students as Brazil, Chile, Mexico, or South Africa. Even in Finland,
where schools were closed for a relatively short period of time, and where students and
teachers had adequate supports to learn remotely, there is evidence of reduced student
engagement during remote instruction. In Norway, another country with robust technological infrastructure, there was a drop in writing proficiency of first grade students

learning loss in the first-grade equivalent to one and a half semesters because of a
two-month period of school closures underscores the limitations of remote instruction. In the United States students with the lowest levels of engagement during the
period of remote instruction were disproportionately low income and racial minority
children.
No cross-national estimates of learning loss during the pandemic are available
yet, but the obvious differences across countries in the duration of the period of
remote learning and in the percentage of students who were reached with the remote
strategies that were implemented suggest that there have been unequal effects across
countries in the extent of learning loss experienced by students, in the inequality of
learning loss for students from different backgrounds within countries, and in the
ensuing disengagement and dropout for those students who learned the least and for
whom the alternative arrangements created during the pandemic were least effective.
The pandemic created a context in which students in least developed countries
experienced the brunt of six mutually reinforcing challenges: the longest school
closures, the lowest levels of resources and institutional capacity to mitigate learning
loss, lower levels of access to vaccines, the greatest increases in poverty, lower
effectiveness of alternative modalities to education, and the greatest levels of social
and educational inequality. For these varied reasons, it is likely that the two most
important mediators of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on educational opportunity
were nationality and social class.

17.2 Educational Opportunity Before the Pandemic,
During the Pandemic, and Beyond
The attempts to educate during the pandemic revealed very large differences in the
social circumstances in which different children access and engage in learning and
made visible the extent to which those differences matter to how much students can
learn. The role played by those circumstances is not unique to the period during
which students were forced to learn from home. The fact that some children live in
homes where they experience food insecurity, or other effects of poverty, including
the stress of living in vulnerable conditions, or the fact that some children have
parents who have less education, time, or resources with which to support them in
their studies was a fact that had influenced opportunity to learn before the pandemic,
it just became more visible during the pandemic. Social class will likely continue
to influence educational opportunity in the aftermath of the pandemic, perhaps its
importance augmented by the increase in poverty and inequality that the pandemic
will produce.
Schools were created, in part, to provide all students opportunities to learn, and
aspirations about their role in equalizing opportunity for all students are about
creating a space to mitigate the differences that those social factors play. The efforts

464

F. M. Reimers

to teach during the pandemic made more visible how very challenging it is to level
the playing field for students given their different social circumstances and how
much harder it is to do that when the work of schools is so directly mediated by
circumstances at home as it was during remote learning.
The evidence examined in this book suggests that, by comparison, in-person
instruction is more effective at leveling the playing field than the arrangements
that education authorities were able to put in place during the pandemic to educate
remotely. This observation needs to be moderated by the fact that the pandemic
had a disproportionate impact in the social circumstances of the poor, making them
more vulnerable to infection or death, or reducing their income, so there would
have likely been increases in inequality of opportunity to learn even if schools
had remained opened the entirety of the pandemic. It should also be acknowledged
that the arrangements to educate remotely were put in place quickly, with limited
resources and support, and so it may be unfair to think of the arrangements of remote
learning that were improvised during the pandemic as the optimal form of remote
learning, although these arrangements represent the largest global experiment in
remote learning at scale since the creation of public schools with the mandate to
educate all children.
Those caveats notwithstanding, one of the lessons surfaced by the pandemic is that
educational opportunity can only be leveled off with actions that effectively meet the
very different needs of children from various circumstances, particularly the many
needs and vulnerabilities caused by poverty, but also other needs including special
learning needs. Those vulnerabilities are considerable and require a clear focus in
supporting students experiencing them, with adequate resources, knowledge, and the
capacity to provide educational and non-educational supports that create an adequate
environment for students to learn. This, of course, is not to say that there was equal
educational opportunity before the pandemic, but it appears that in-person instruction
is more effective at equalizing opportunity than remote instruction. Low-income
students, those in earlier grades, and special needs students were the least adequately
supported to learn remotely.
There were some countries in which attention and resources were disproportionately targeted to support the education of disadvantaged students, although no
information is available on the extent to which these were able to prevent an increase
in inequality in opportunity to learn. In Singapore, where students and teachers had
developed skills for online learning prior to the pandemic, and where the use of Digipedagogies intensified in preparation for school closures, the government distributed
computers and provided connectivity to the students who lacked them as part of the
remote learning strategy. Singapore’s modest interruption of schooling was largely
a result of the effective containment of the health crisis and of coordination between
education and health authorities.
In Portugal, policy pronouncements emphasized the priority of maintaining educational opportunity during remote learning, and partnerships between organizations
of civil society and government agencies made efforts to reach out to disadvantaged
students. In Japan, the government distributed devices to disadvantaged students
during the phase of remote learning.

17 Conclusions …

In Norway, despite the adequate access to infrastructure and high levels of teacher
quality, the engagement of low achieving students during remote instruction diminished more than the engagement of their high achieving peers. Furthermore this
country where equality of educational opportunity is normally a policy priority, did
not implement strategies to equalize opportunity during the remote learning phase.
The vast differences among students in different schools in their capacity to learn
from alternative arrangements also underscores the urgency of democratizing the
opportunity to learn autonomously, a likely precondition for lifelong learning. Unless
schools provide greater access to connectivity and devices, and the skills to learn
remotely for all students and teachers, they will be denying some students essential skills to learn independently throughout their lives and arguably denying them
the opportunity to participate fully in society, as such participation is increasingly
mediated by technological means.
One of the challenges of the multimodal strategies of remote learning deployed by
several countries during the pandemic is that the most advantaged children had access
to the most interactive modalities, such as internet-based options which provided
opportunities for interaction, whereas those least advantaged had to rely on radio or
printed materials or on digital options that were only used to transmit content, with
limited opportunities for interaction and feedback. In South Africa, for instance,
a considerable number of low-income black children had no access to internet or
devices to support learning remotely. A similar lack of access to online remote
instruction was observed, to varying degrees, among low-income students in most
countries, although higher income countries were able to remediate these needs by
providing devices and connectivity, as was the case in Finland, Japan, or Singapore,
and only the best prepared and supported teachers were able to create opportunities
for interaction with their students.
At the same time, the deficiencies shown by the digitally-based solutions enacted
during the pandemic, even in contexts in which students and teachers had considerable access to devices, connectivity, and benefited from prior experience in Digipedagogies, such as in Finland, or in countries which made efforts to provide such
access during the pandemic, underscore the social and multidimensional nature of
learning, and the unique value of in-person interaction to derive the full benefits of
the school. We learn with others, in interaction with them and by collaborating with
them, and those social interactions are essential to the integration of thoughts and
emotions which sustain learning. It is collaboration with others and this interaction
that sustains our motivation and helps us learn, as our brains are wired for social
interaction—not just with teachers, but with peers, and not just in activities led by
teachers in the context of the formal curriculum, but in activities led by students. This
is true both for the intended and explicit curriculum and for the implicit and tacit
curriculum—what we learn from interacting with others. In-person instruction also
facilitates multiple ways of learning with and from others, not just while students
work at their desks in the classroom, but when they engage in sports or the arts, or
simply in spontaneous and informal conversation with peers. In Russia, for instance,
educators and students agree that the quality of remote instruction was lower than
in-person instruction, especially for subjects which required student participation,

466

F. M. Reimers

such as physical education, arts, music, or, paradoxically, technology. Less than half
of the parents in Russia indicated that remote instruction provided opportunities for
interaction with teachers. Chap. 15, examining remote instruction in five OECD countries, shows that most remote instruction consisted primarily of delivering lessons
and content, with very limited opportunities for interaction. In the United States, the
utilization of online instruction increased with the level of education and of income
of the parents, whereas children of low-income parents were more likely to rely
on printed materials. The same study shows that parents were concerned about the
quality of remote education, and about the limited opportunities for social development it provided. Chap. 5 shows that in Japan there was an increase in student
depression during the period of remote instruction. Even while acknowledging the
hasty nature of the alternative arrangements put in place during the pandemic resulted
in a sub-optimal way to organize remote instruction, and to support collaboration
and social interaction with peers, the deficiencies of such arrangements suggest that
there are unique benefits to in-person instruction and suggest that digital instruction
is a deficient replacement for in person schooling.
The heterogeneous results of learning remotely during the pandemic are not just
a function of the different ways in which the pandemic impacted students and their
families, but of the fact that, in the rapid and fluid context in which alternative delivery
systems were developed, there were no standards and no consistency. As a result,
on top of the already considerable inequality of education conditions experienced
by students in school systems which segregate disadvantaged students to schools
of low quality the lack of standards and inconsistency in approaches diminished
opportunities to learn under remote learning. Such lack of standards was most problematic in highly decentralized systems such as the United States, which left school
districts to define what remote instruction would mean, resulting in vast inequalities in approaches as shown in Chaps. 14 and 15. Also in Chile, Mexico, Russia,
and South Africa vast preexisting inequalities, high decentralization, and deficient
guidance and support exacerbated inequalities in remote learning opportunities.
This heterogeneity, resulting from a lack of clear standards and insufficient
compensatory efforts to close equity gaps, extended even to whether the goals of the
strategy for remote instruction were to maintain students’ engagement with education, actually support learning, provide guidance for the amount of learning time, or
define what was meant by remote instruction. As shown in Chap. 15, in France, and
in the United States remote instruction prioritized maintaining student engagement
over learning new content. The same finding is reported in Chap. 13, focusing on
remote instruction during the pandemic in the United States.

17.3 The Role of Initial Conditions Mediating
the Educational Impact of the Pandemic
Education systems were in varying stages of readiness to sustain educational opportunity in the face of the disruptions caused by the pandemic. Those differences included
access to connectivity at home and skills to learn and teach online, as well as level of
resources, capacities, and institutional structures to meet gaps during the emergency.
Whereas Finland, Japan, Norway, and Singapore had high levels of connectivity,
and resources to provide equipment and connectivity to students during the interruption of in person instruction, levels of connectivity and resources were lower in
Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and South Africa. Russia had high levels of connectivity but
low bandwidth. It should be noted, however, that even countries with high per-capita
income and high levels of connectivity, such as Finland, Japan, and Singapore, found
that vulnerable groups of children lacked access to digital devices at home. However,
these countries were able to provide devices to students once it became clear that
they needed them. Similarly, in Australia, France, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and
the United States, a sizable number of children, predominantly from low-income
and minority backgrounds, had challenges with access to connectivity and devices.
Other countries, such as Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and South Africa, facing even greater
levels of exclusion from connectivity and devices, found it more challenging to meet
these needs during the emergency.
Similar gaps were observed in teacher capacity. Whereas Finland, Japan, Norway,
and Singapore had made greater investments in Digi-pedagogies prior to the
pandemic compared to other countries, which eased their transition to remote instruction, countries such as Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and South Africa had not made such
investments and consequently found it more challenging to adopt remote instructional strategies. In Finland, the switch to distance learning during the period of
school closure was relatively seamless. Nevertheless, even in that context there was
less learning during remote instruction as revealed by the lower percentage of students
who experienced optimal learning moments in STEM during remote instruction than
during in person instruction. In Mexico, the national strategy relied on platforms to
transmit content, such as radio and television, acknowledging that the deep gaps in
teachers’ capacity in Digi-pedagogies in many public schools would considerably
limit the reach of a strategy based in online learning.
Institutional fragmentation and school segregation contributed to augmenting
inequality, as was the case in Chile, South Africa, Spain, and the United States.
In Chile, as shown in Chap. 3, the already-large inequalities in educational opportunity, produced by a highly stratified education system, were augmented with remote
instruction, because of differential capacities of schools to provide adequate supports
to the varying needs of children. South Africa’s two-tiered system for students from
different socioeconomic groups saw the greatest reductions in opportunities to learn
in high poverty schools. In Spain, extreme discontinuities in education policy over
the years and high institutional fragmentation undermined the effects of national
guidance and support to teach remotely, as those were mediated by decisions made

468

F. M. Reimers

in the autonomous regions of the country. In the United States, decentralization of
governance and finance resulted in vastly unequal levels of engagement with remote
education among students of different socio-economic and ethnic background.
The mechanisms to compensate for social disparities, providing more focus and
resources to disadvantaged students, were weaker for remote learning than for inperson instruction. Portugal stands out as a country in which policy guidance prioritized maintaining equality of educational opportunity and Singapore was able to
rapidly compensate the lower levels of connectivity of children from disadvantaged
homes. Even Norway, with a long-standing commitment to equal educational opportunity, lacked specific programs to provide differentiated support to disadvantaged
students learning remotely. In contexts of greater institutional fragility, such as Brazil,
Chile, Mexico, Spain, and South Africa, compensatory efforts during remote learning
were even more elusive.

17.4 The Silver Linings
Fully acknowledging the shortcomings of the rapidly designed and implemented
arrangements that were created to educate during the pandemic, and in particular their
limitations to close the pre-existing equity gaps that were in many cases augmented
by the different ways the pandemic affected the circumstances of children from
different social classes, there is no question that teachers, education authorities, civil
society organizations, and parents made considerable efforts to maintain education
during the pandemic, creating numerous innovations to do so.
Furthermore, such efforts to maintain education were made in a context of imperfect and evolving knowledge about how the virus spread and with uncertainty
regarding when a vaccine would be available and when the pandemic would be
brought under control, which created uncertainty about whether schools were likely
environments to spread the virus.
It is remarkable that education remained a priority for governments during a
time when the public health emergency—and its economic consequences—placed
considerable burdens on government resources and capacity. This speaks to the institutionalization of the idea that education is indeed not just a human right, but a basic
need, an essential activity for children and that it had to be protected and continued.
In the cases in which the national government did not prioritize supporting the continuity of education during the pandemic, as in Brazil, this was mostly over contention
about jurisdiction and, in that case, state and municipal governments stepped up to
prioritize education. In the United States also, the federal government failed to lead in
maintaining a priority for education, but this is consistent with the fact that education
is primarily a state and local responsibility. In Mexico, where the national government
developed a national strategy for remote education based on television, perceived by
many as insufficient, state governments supplemented it with other delivery channels including radio, online instruction, and printed materials. In other countries in
which regional or local authorities have primary responsibility for education, such

17 Conclusions …

469

as Finland, Japan, Russia and Spain, the national government took a more proactive
role during the pandemic providing guidance and support to prioritize the continuity
of education.
It is not always the case that education is prioritized in other contexts of emergency,
such as those created by a civil conflict or natural disaster. In contrast, the efforts
to generate and fund alternative approaches to educate during the pandemic were
significant. By comparison to the relatively low priority that the education of refugee
children, for example, receives from governments and from international development organizations, the response of governments and international agencies to the
education needs of children whose education was challenged by the pandemic was
of a considerably greater order of magnitude. If the same commitment and priority
to educate displaced and refugee children were extended to reverting the educational
disruptions caused by their displacement, their educational opportunities would be
considerably greater than they are at present.
Just as admirable as governments’ and societal commitment to maintaining education during the pandemic was the velocity at which alternative arrangements to
educate were established, particularly during the early phase of the pandemic, the
phase of immediate lock down of schools. In a matter of days and weeks alternative ways to sustain engagement with education were established, often the result of
partnerships between governments and organizations of civil society and the private
sector. The reliance on these novel delivery systems developed the Digi-pedagogies
of students and teachers, or novel forms of co-teaching, as was the case in Finland,
Norway, and Singapore. These rapidly developed efforts were, in hindsight, deficient,
and the reason for the learning loss and increase in inequalities discussed earlier. But
the sheer speed at which they were launched, often repurposing existing infrastructure and assets, is worthy of recognition. For example, the TV and radio-based
programming deployed as a strategy for education continuity in Mexico repurposed
existing digital assets from the Mexican television industry. When national initiatives
to sustain education were deemed ineffective, or insufficient, subnational governments and other organizations of civil society stepped up to enhance or replace those
efforts, as was the case in Brazil and Mexico. In Chile, there was an increase in social
participation, through the use of online platforms, in defining what constituted quality
education in the context of the pandemic, and as a result of such social dialogue, more
emphasis was given to providing emotional support to students. In the United States,
surveys of teachers and principals reported the greatest needs for support to be in the
areas of socioemotional development and mental health, as described in Chap. 13.
These efforts in collective leadership to mitigate the education losses caused by
the pandemic are also noteworthy and indicative of the shared recognition of the
importance of education, and of schools, to society.
Perhaps the most remarkable expression of this institutionalization of the idea
that education is not just a right, but an essential human right, is that it was not just
national or subnational governments, organizations of civil society, or international
organizations that stepped up to innovate in order to sustain education—teachers and
parents did as well. The pandemic created a context for true empowerment of parents,
communities, and teachers in devising approaches to educate children remotely. The

470

F. M. Reimers

significance of that empowerment should not be lost even though the results of such a
massive global effort in service of educating children were insufficient to preserve the
right to education for all children, or to maintain the opportunity to learn that children
would have had in the absence of the pandemic. The real counterfactual against which
to assess these efforts should not be an idealized scenario in which a pandemic had
not taken place (although one could imagine scenarios in which the public health
crisis had been better managed than it was in many jurisdictions), but one without
these efforts to sustain education, one in which parents, teachers, civil society, and
governments had given up in trying to educate children during this most difficult and
challenging moment for humanity, and had decided to put the right of education on
hold until further notice. It is to be celebrated that this was not the response of most
societies and governments, even if, unfortunately, for some children, it was the result
they experienced in practice because what was done was insufficient to mitigate the
many other ways in which the combination of poverty and the pandemic challenged
them and their families. As already mentioned, the percentage of students facing that
complete shut-down from education varied greatly across countries because of the
different extent of poverty across countries and of differences in access to education
resources and effective programs.
The urgency of addressing the many needs involved in sustaining education in
the challenging context created by the pandemic also made visible the shortcomings
in the institutional capacity of schools and education systems and stimulated the
creation of networks and partnerships as a way to address those shortcomings and
augment that capacity. The efforts to sustain education against the odds led to much
collaboration within schools, across schools, between schools and other institutions,
and across different government entities. These collaborations, intra-education and
between education and other sectors, such as health, led to innovations and emphasized that such collaborations are essential to finding ways to address the many and
multidimensional needs of students. The urgency to augment teacher capacity in
Digi-pedagogies led many schools to support collaboration so that teachers could
share what they were learning about teaching remotely, and often these collaborations extended across schools. In Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa, for instance, civil
society organizations and universities stepped up to play a critical role supporting
schools and teachers during remote learning.
The awareness that complex education challenges require a considerable level of
institutional capacity and that the level of the school may be inadequate, too small,
to provide appropriate responses, in addition to the realization of how capacity can
be augmented by relying on school networks integrated with other institutions, such
as universities or non-governmental organizations, has great value to continue to
address the various education challenges that will persist during the pandemic and
its aftermath.
The very visible ways in which the pandemic affected the wellbeing of all created
a context to prioritize the wellbeing of students. This surfaced ideas about the need
of educating the whole child, attending to their emotional well-being as well as to
their nutrition, physical activity, and cognitive development. In Chile, for example,
interest in socio-emotional development of children augmented during the pandemic,

17 Conclusions …

471

as it did in other countries examined in this book such as Japan or Mexico. In turn,
the recognition of the limitations of the alternative means to deliver education and in
the circumstances under which students were studying stimulated a reprioritization
of the curriculum, and with it, to focusing on the intended learning outcomes for
students rather than on the content that was initially planned to be transmitted during
a regular school year.
This focus on competencies over content, the obvious shortcomings of the
extended time students were spending at home, and the evident struggles of some
students to learn independently surfaced the need to think expansively about the
competencies that will help students develop into autonomous adults were some of
the significant silver linings of the pandemic, which might carry over into the future.
Perhaps the greatest educational silver lining of the pandemic was the awareness
it created about how much schools matter, not just to deliver education, but to the
functioning of society. The question of how much schools matter is a recurrent one
in the fields of the sociology and the economics of education. It is a very difficult
question to answer in societies in which most students attend school, for there is no
relevant comparison group, reducing most comparisons to those between students
who have accessed different levels or grades or education, or who have been educated
in different types of schools. Most of those comparisons suffer from methodological
limitations in the ability to properly account for unobserved differences between
the groups with different levels of education. Learning remotely during part of the
duration of the pandemic provided, unfortunately, a way to experience what it is like
to try to learn with schools functioning in very limited ways, and more importantly,
of what it is like for society to try to function when schools are closed. That natural
experiment will help estimate how much schools matter. The evidence examined in
this book makes clear that education in school is more effective in supporting learning
for all children than the alternatives that were put in place for remote instruction,
a view shared by educators and parents in Russia, for example. This awareness of
the importance of education, coupled with the augmented visibility of the unequal
conditions in which students learned, increased the salience of initiatives to advance
equal opportunity. In Russia, for instance, where inequality had been a relatively
absent topic on the policy agenda, the pandemic brought increased attention to this
topic.

17.5 The Challenges Ahead
The educational challenges created by the pandemic are not over and may not be
over even when the pandemic is under control. To bring it under control, communities and nations will need to achieve herd immunity, which requires somewhere
between 60 and 80% of the world population to be vaccinated. Reaching this level
of immunization requires the availability of vaccines, a willingness of at least that
percentage of the population to be vaccinated, and that no new strands of the virus,
more contagious and resistant to the available vaccines, develop. Based only on the

472

F. M. Reimers

estimated supply of vaccine doses, it is unlikely that this level of immunity will be
reached, for most of the world, until well into 2022. Reluctance to be vaccinated
and new strands of the virus could complicate the odds of achieving herd immunity.
The reality that the pandemic will linger for some time, perhaps well into 2022,
means that there are three kinds of education challenges: those involved in adapting
to learning and teaching during the context created by the pandemic, in some cases
involving remote distancing; of teachers and students, those involved in mitigating
learning loss and ensuring that students learn what they need to learn; and those
involved in reverting learning loss and building back better.
Beyond the need to mitigate learning loss and to continue to educate while the
pandemic is still a risk, the education impact of the pandemic on the conditions children experience at home will continue during the pandemic’s aftermath, in particular
for those children whose families experience the brunt of the increase in poverty,
food insecurity, and other shocks and vulnerabilities resulting from low income and
marginalization.
This will require addressing the mental health challenges triggered by the
pandemic, and the learning gaps caused by the pandemic, while also developing
the skills necessary to address the new challenges, some of them caused by or
compounded by the pandemic, such as social fragmentation and violence, growing
poverty and inequality, diminished employment prospects, diminished trust in
government, and climate change. Education systems face the triple challenge of
recovering what was lost during the pandemic, addressing education challenges
predating the pandemic, and aligning their response to prepare students for new
societal and economic challenges and to build a better future.
Furthermore, given a likely economic recession and the burden of the costs of
addressing the pandemic, it is conceivable that these challenges will need to be
addressed in a context of financial austerity, for governments as well as individuals. The pandemic itself and its impact on other challenges is also likely to stretch
government capacity, and with it the capacity to focus on education.
The constraints on financial resources will increase burdens on existing staff,
already exhausted from the extraordinary efforts expended in sustaining education
during the pandemic, having had to learn to teach in new ways, in a short time and
with limited support, and learning to face new needs among their students created by
the pandemic. Even in Finland, which had made investments in supporting teachers’
capacities in Digi-pedagogies prior to the pandemic, there is evidence of teacher
stress and burnout. There is similar evidence of burnout in the United States, as seen
in Chaps. 13 and 14, where teachers are working more under remote instruction
and enjoying teaching less. In Arizona, as discussed in Chap. 14, an already acute
challenge of teacher shortages could be complicated by the new stresses on teaching
caused by the pandemic.
Given the considerable learning loss experienced by many students during the
pandemic, learning recovery programs will be essential. To identify what needs
to be remedied, assessment of students will be necessary as well as differentiated
responses by schools and for different students. Targeted and personalized programs
might include accelerated programs, extended learning time, dropout prevention

17 Conclusions …

473

programs, and increasing the capacity to learn and teach online, not just as a preventative measure against possible further interruptions of schooling but to enable extended
learning time and to prepare students for lifelong learning. As explained in Chap. 13,
information on what students are learning will be a critical resource to support effective efforts of remediation and recovery. Beyond programs of cognitive support,
the emotional trauma caused by the prolonged stress experienced by students and
teachers during the pandemic, and by the losses directly experienced by some of
them, will need to be addressed through appropriate interventions. For the children
experiencing the effects of poverty, those experiencing food insecurity for instance,
programs to attend to their nutrition and health will be essential.
One of the main challenges during remote learning and in the pandemic aftermath will be maintaining high goals and expectations for students and schools. It is
evident that, during remote learning, a view of educational opportunity as learning
was displaced by a view of opportunity as access to education and engagement.
This represents a setback in the understanding of educational opportunity, which had
slowly transitioned over many decades from understanding opportunity as access, to
understanding opportunity as learning, to opportunity as learning for all, to opportunity as learning what is needed and relevant. Maintaining the focus on high level
goals for education systems in a context of diminished capacity and obvious setbacks
will require leadership, resources, innovation, and systems that allow continuous
improvement.
Another challenge in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic will be that in
response to the stress and trauma created by the frustrations experienced learning
and teaching during the pandemic, there might be a rejection of assimilating the
possible silver linings and opportunities; for example, refusing to integrate Digipedagogies in the curriculum or denying the severity of learning loss and refusing
to implement programs to remedy it. The pandemic may have blurred the memories
of the many preexisting deficiencies of schools, and this, coupled with the likely
austerity, may displace the urgency to ‘build back better’ and impede learning any
of the potentially valuable lessons resulting from the innovations put in place to
educate during the pandemic. For example, in Finland there is some evidence that
remote learning may have worked differently for students in different grades, for
different subjects or for different students. Also, in Norway the engagement of lowachieving students declined more than for high-achieving students. Discerning under
what circumstances distance learning can be most effective would be of great value to
expand the capacity of the school. Similarly, the forms of teacher collaboration, with
peers within and across schools, to provide just-in-time professional development
to augment their capacity to teach remotely provide an opportunity to advance what
we know about augmenting institutional capacity. There may be valuable lessons
in those collaborations to help deepen the capacity of schools to become learning
organizations. Schools as learning organizations are characterized by seven features,
which appear to have characterized the practices in which several schools engaged
to generate and sustain remote education:

474

developing and sharing a vision centered on the learning of all students;
creating and supporting continuous learning opportunities for all staff;
promoting team learning and collaboration among staff;
establishing a culture of inquiry, innovation, and exploration;
establishing embedded systems for collecting and exchanging knowledge and
learning;
learning with and from the external environment and larger learning system;
and
modelling and growing learning leadership (Kools & Stoll 2016, p.3).

(7)

One of the lessons learned during the pandemic concerns the role of good central
governance and support in ensuring consistent standards and closing equity gaps.
Singapore and Brazil provide two extremes in a continuum from good to poor
governance. Whereas Singapore adopted a whole of government approach, with
appropriate coordination between the education and the health sectors, and with the
education sector providing clear and consistent guidance and support to all schools,
in Brazil the national government education response was mostly absent, while the
public health response was ineffective. In that context, States and local authorities,
teachers and parents were left to their own devices to figure out what to do, and state
governments and civil society organizations stepped up to make up for the absence
and ineffectual governmental response. Finland and Japan provide also examples of
effective national government response, coordinating a national education strategy
of education continuity, while Mexico and Spain provide examples of a national
strategy of remote learning, judged ineffective by States and local jurisdictions, who
stepped up to make up for the absence of an effective national strategy. In countries
where the central state had limited jurisdiction over schools and did not assume an
effective compensatory role, such as Chile, Spain, Russia, and the United States,
there were greater inequalities in the education strategies adopted across regions and
schools.
To conclude, the COVID-19 pandemic created an education crisis which robbed
many students of the opportunities to learn what they were expected to and caused
them to lose skills they had already gained. These losses were unequally distributed
among different students and education systems and, as a result, if they are not
reversed, the outcome of the pandemic will be increased educational inequality,
from which economic and social inequality will follow. These will further complicate
other social challenges, which predated the pandemic but were exacerbated by it: the
challenge of increasing productivity, reducing poverty and inequality, increasing civic
cohesion and trust in institutions and democratic governance, and addressing issues
such as climate change or intra and interstate violence. This impact of the pandemic
will most certainly extend beyond the period studied in this book, corresponding to
the first year since the pandemic was declared in March of 2020. The pandemic is
not under control yet and some of the ways in which it is impacting education, for
instance through a new financial austerity for individuals and for education systems,
will continue in the immediate aftermath.

17 Conclusions …

475

Despite these obvious challenges, it is not a foregone conclusion that we should
accept these terrible education losses and their dire outcomes as destiny. It is likely
that programs can be developed and implemented to mitigate and revert the education
losses, and perhaps even to address preexisting education challenges as we seek to
‘build back better’ as part of the response to the pandemic. To do this, governments
could rely on the unprecedented social mobilization around education and on the
innovation dividend that was generated to sustain education during the pandemic,
on the extraordinary efforts and collaborations among parents, teachers, education
administrators, as well as across the public and private sectors, levels of government,
and nations. If there was ever a time when collective leadership was necessary, indeed
essential, in education, this is it. We conclude this book in the hope that it contributes
to that process of leading together, from all corners of the world, so we can build
back better and restore opportunities for children and youth to gain the skills to build
a more inclusive and sustainable world.
